# The ***C'escacs*** web site

This is the [*C'escacs*](https://github.com/cescacs) Web site, *a large hexagonal chess variant, which is played in a 169 hexes board, and enriched with the Capablanca's pieces*, as I usually define it to newcomers... but it really offers much more. See the [Web site](https://cescacs.github.io), also published in the [orgfree.com](https://cescacs.orgfree.com) domain.

The rules are very similar to those of orthodox chess, adapting the movements to the hexagonal board, but it also adds some new pieces (elephants, dragons and pegasus).

This repository includes a mirror of the *C'escacs* javascript repository in the
`cescacs.javascripit` directory, which allows to try out the game
(it is a private repository from *S-Cesc* github user).
There is its own [README](cescacs.javascripit/README.md) file and
[TODO](cescacs.javascripit/TODO.md) list.

The ***TODO*** list for this Web site can be found in the root [TODO](TODO.md) file.

				primitive chess</h2>
			<p>The origin of chess is unknown, but the game of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaturanga"
						target="_blank" class="cite">Chaturanga</a></em> in India, mentioned in the <i>Mahābhārata</i>,
				is
				generally considered to be the earliest precursor. <i>Chaturanga</i> is recorded to have been played
				as early as the 6th century.
			</p>
			<p>Considering that, after the time of <i>Alexander the Great</i>, the Greeks maintained close contact
				with India for several centuries, the silence of Greek writers on the existence of chess is
				considered evidence of the non-existence of chess in those times.
			</p>
			<p>As <i>Daniel Willard Fiske</i> (1831-1904) pointed out:</p>
			<blockquote class="w3-container w3-cursive w3-xlarge" style="margin-bottom: 1.8em;">
				Before the 7th century CE, the existence of chess in any country cannot be proved with the slightest
				documentary or reliable evidence. Beyond that date, all is impenetrable darkness.<br>
				<p class="w3-right w3-small w3-sans-serif" style="margin: 0.2em 1em 0em 3em;">

				<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaturanga" target="_blank" class="cite">Chaturanga</a>
					(चतुरङ्ग) is a game with origins in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gupta_Empire"
						target="_blank" class="cite">Gupta Empire</a>, and would come to mean <i>four armies</i>
					(literally, <i>having four members</i>, chaturanga - चतुरङ्ग caturaṅga, catuḥ: "four"; anga:
					"arms"),
					beeing <i>hasty-ashwa-ratha-padatam</i> (<i>elephants-horses-carts-foot soldiers</i>) the
					classic formation of the armies of India, as described by the
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akshauhini" target="_blank" class="cite">Akshauhini</a>
					en el <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata" target="_blank"
						class="cite">Mahabharata</a>.
					The oldest known reference dates from the 6th century AD, although the represented armies correspond
					to
					the time of <i>Alexander the Great</i> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurya_Empire"
						class="cescacs" target="_blank">Maurya Empire</a>, between the 4th century BC and the 2nd
					century BC.
					There is also a Chinese chess (Xiangqi, 象棋) with representations which correspond to the 1st century
					BC.
					Interestingly, <b><a href="http://history.chess.free.fr/sources.htm" class="cite"
							target="_blank">the oldest references</a></b> are not directly from the
					<i>Chaturanga</i>, but to the arrival as <a href="#Xatranj" class="cite"><i>Shatranj</i></a> to
					Persia from India, and some more diffuse texts from China.

						<p>In the case of the <i>Gaja</i> (Elephants) the exact movement is unknown, existing
							different theories; I personally subscribe to the likelihood of the move matching
							that which has persisted in some Southeast Asian chess
							<small>and also Japanese <cite>Shogi</cite> <cite>silver general</cite></small>
							already described by <a href="https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Birun%C3%AD"
								target="_blank" class="cite">al-Biruni</a> around 1030 in his book <q>India</q>.
						</p>
						<p>The movement of two squares diagonally occurs in the <i>Nauca</i> del
							<a href="#Xaturaji" class="cite"><i>Chaturaji</i></a>, where its weakness
							is obvious. This move carried over to Persian <i>Chatrang</i>
							and Chinese <i>Xiangqi</i>, but the elephant in India is unlikely to have been
							represented with such a weak piece, as can be seen in the 
							<a href="#Escacsvariantindia" class="cescacs">Indian variant of modern chess</a>.
						</p>
						<aside class="w3-container" style="display:flex;">
							<p>The Burmese, Thai, and Cambodian chess variants have now merged into what is
								known as <a href="https://aseanchess.org/laws-of-asean-chess/"
									target="_blank" class="cite"><abbr
										title="Association of Southeast Asian Nations">ASEAN</abbr>
									(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Chess</a>, because they shared rules
								and the movement of the elephant, although with different names for this piece. 
							</p>
						</aside>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The movement of the <i>Ratha</i> (Chariot) is also not completely certain, although it is thought
					that the movement corresponds exactly to the movement of the modern <i>Rook</i>. We have multiple
					games with horizontal and vertical movements, as in the Indian <a href="#Xaturaji"
					class="cite">Xaturaji</a>, in the Arabic <a href="#Xatranj" class="cite">Xatranj</a>, and in many
					other games in different places: in the <span lang="ja">飛車</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">hisha</span>
					("flying chariot") of the Japanese shōgi (<span lang="ja">将棋</span>), in the <span lang="zh">车</span>
					<q>chariot</q> of the Chinese Xiangqi (<span lang="zh">象棋</span>), or in the Viking Hnefatafl;
					moreover, although the rules have not come down to us, it seems that this movement would also exist
					in the <a href="#Petteia" class="cite">Ludus latrunculorum</a> of the Romans, or even in the
					<a href="#Petteia" class="cite">Petteia</a> of the Greeks.
				</p>
				<p>It is also possible that the <i>Xaturanga</i> evolved, with more than one version, or variants,
					existing in each area, and the success and standardisation of the <a href="#Xatranj"
						class="cite">Xatranj</a> in the next Islamic world could be seen as just another variant.
					Thus it was probably the reputation of the Persian origin of <i>Xatranj</i> that left
					<i>Xaturanga</i> forgotten; the Islamic era in India began with the first colonies in the 8th
					century and sultanates from the 10th century onwards, but the important Mughal era did not begin
					until the 16th century, and from the 17th century onwards the influence of Western chess in India
					was already evident.

				<p><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaturaji" class="cite" target="_blank">Chaturaji</a></i>
					means <i>four rajahs</i>,
					and is an evolution of the <i>Chaturanga</i> in India itself. It was a game that
					incorporated dice that the player rolled to determine which piece to move. It
					incorporates the <i>Nauca</i> (<i>Boat</i>), which jumps two squares diagonally,
					so the squares it can reach are very limited. In this game the <i>Gaja</i>
					(<i>Elephant</i>) moves like the current <i>rook</i>, representing the most powerful piece.
				</p>
				<div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap">
					<div style="flex:1;margin:0.5em; padding:0.5em; border:1px solid black;">
						<p>The piece to be moved was determined with a long four-sided die:
						</p>
						<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
							<li><i>Pedàti</i> (<i>Pawn</i>) or <i>Rajah</i></li>
							<li><i>Nauca</i> (<i>Boat</i>)</li>
							<li><i>Ashva</i> (<i>Knight</i>)</li>
							<li><i>Gaja</i> (<i>Elephant</i>)</li>
						</ol>
						<p><small>You can also use a four-sided tetrahedral die, or if you only have a cubic die
							(hexahedron) use the value five equivalent to the value one, and six equivalent to
							the value four.
						</small></p>
					</div>
					<div style="flex:1;margin:0.5em; padding:0.5em; border:1px solid black;">
						<p>Valuation of the pieces was:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><i>Pedàti</i> (<i>Pawn</i>): 1</li>
							<li><i>Nauca</i> (<i>Boat</i>): 2</li>
							<li><i>Ashva</i> (<i>Knight</i>): 3</li>

				<p>While <i>Chaturanga</i> would mean <q>four armies</q>: infantry, cavalry, chariots and elephants,
					<i>Chaturaji</i> means <q>four rajahs</q>, a way of saying <q>four players</q>. Chess with more
					than two players have a tendency to degenerate, losing the strategic component to prevail
					diplomacy between players, unbalancing the game. But we remember that <i>Chaturaji</i> is a game
					with a large component of chance, and, moreover, in <i>Chaturaji</i> it seems that the players
					form two pairs, playing one pair against the other. In any case, it may be a game inspired by
					chess and with certain connections, but it cannot be considered chess, as we could say of
					<i>Chaturanga</i> or other variants that we will mention here.

					<h4 style="display: flex;" class="w3-container w3-deep-purple w3-center w3-text-light-grey
						w3-opacity w3-large title header4"><span>Chaturaji rules</span></h4>
					<p>The aim is not to capture the enemy Rajah, which is just another piece on the board, but to
						score points by capturing pieces; the exception is the rule that the game is won by the player
						who captures the Rajahs of the other three players, scoring the equivalent of the three whole
						navies, 54 points, since each navy is valued at 18 points; This victory is called
						<i>Chaturaji</i>.
					</p>
					<p>The order of player turns is clockwise, and fronted players are allied. Each player moves two
						pieces each turn by rolling one die twice or by rolling two dice simultaneously. When both dice
						indicate the same piece, the same piece may be moved twice, or if two such pieces are available
						then two different pieces of that type may be moved. If movement of the dice indicated piece is
						impossible, or, if the player doesn't want to move it, as the player is not obliged to move,
						then the full turn is lost.
					</p>
					<div class="note">
						<p>
						Note that when playing with two dices and that case arises on the second throw, the
						first move had already been done, and it is not undone; so, It is different to play
						with one die or with two. It should also be noted that allied pieces can be captured,
						but not your own.</p>
					</div>
					<p>The game ends when there are no pieces left in play for the opposing players, but it can also
						end when all the players agree to end the game. At the end of the game, the points are counted.
						Other rules:
					</p>
					<dl class="icon iconGrid">
						<dt>Shatpada (six steps): pawn promotion</dt>
						<dd>If the conditions arise, a pawn that reaches the last square would promote to the type of
							piece that would be positioned on that column on the initial setup (of your own column or your
							ally's column).</dd>
						<dd>When a pawn reaches the final rank but may not promote, then the pawn stays as a pawn on the
							square on the final row. As soon as he may promote, the pawn is changed into the respective
							piece. In the mean time, the pawn can be taken.</dd>
						<dd>When a player owns three or four pawns, a pawn may not promote.</dd>
						<dd>When a player has one or two pawns, he may promote to <i>Knight</i> or <i>Elephant</i>.</dd>
						<dd>Only when a player possesses a single pawn and the <i>Rajah</i>, and at most the <i>Boat</i>
							but no other pieces, may he promote to <i>Ship</i>, or a second <i>Rajah</i>.</dd>
						<dd>As an exception, a player without <i>Rajah</i> can always promote to <i>Rajah</i> when a pawn
							reaches the last row of a <i>Rajah</i>'s column.</dd>
		
						<dt>Vrihannauka: Boat triumph</dt>
						<dd>When a boat moves such that a 2×2 square filled with boats is formed, 
							it captures all three boats of the other players.</dd>

						<dt><i>Rajah</i> capture</dt>
						<dd>If a player loses his <i>Rajah</i> he cannot move any pieces, except for pawns. His pieces
							remain on the board and can be taken. 
							<ul>
								<li>The partner can choose to exchange <i>Rajahs</i> and rescue him by replacing him.</li>
								<li>Pawns of a player who had lost its <i>Rajah</i> can't capture a <i>Rajah</i>.</li>
								<li>When capturing an enemy <i>Rajah</i>, if the partner's <i>Rajah</i> has been captured
									by that enemy army, it can be demanded the <i>Rajah</i>'s exchange, and then both
									<i>Rajahs</i> are returned to its starting position, or to an adjacent one if it is
									occupied.</li>
								<li>Otherwise, the player who captures the last enemy <i>Rajah</i>, if his partner's
									<i>Rajah</i> has also been captured, will take control over the ally army to
									defeat the frozen enemies using both armies.</li>
							</ul>				
						</dd>

						<dt>Sinhasana</dt>
						<dd>Whoever moves a <i>Rajah</i> to enter the original square of another <i>Rajah</i> is said to
							have gained a <i>sinhasana</i>. If a player gains a <i>sinhasana</i> on the allied player's
							throne (player whose pieces are opposite), both allies take control of both armies.
							<i>sinhasana</i> rules on an enemy throne are related to gambling.</dd>

						<dt>Cacacashta</dt>
						<dd>When <i>Rajah</i> is left without its army it is neither victory nor a defeat.</dd>
					</dl>
					<p>It was a gambling game with stakes, and some of the rules were complicated, we don't know them
						well and they might even have had versions in different places. Either way, we can add some
						<em>adapted rules</em> to play with points:
					</p>
					<ul class="icon iconSquarePlus">
						<li><b>Point tally</b>: Pairs can be kept or changed over a series of different games, keeping
							the points earned by each player, but it must be noted that a typical series of games would
							be a series of four games, without changing pairs.</li>
						<li><b><i>Cacacashta</i> point tally</b>: The <i>cacacashta</i> situation (lonely <i>Rajah</i>)
							means that no one counts the points of the captured pieces to that army (player) in the game,
							it's like a draw with that player; the <i>Rajah</i> is removed from board and pieces are
							returned to the player (they do not count), who also returns any piece which would had
							captured (they also do not count). Note that the allied can force the situation capturing
							the last allied piece.</li>
						<li><b><i>Sinhasana</i> on an enemy throne</b>: Gaining a <i>sinhasana</i> on an enemy throne
							doubles the value of its Rajah (10 points) if captured while the throne remains occupied,
							but capturing the enemy <i>Rajah</i> on his throne by gaining a <i>sinhasana</i>, i.e.
							capturing the enemy <i>Rajah</i> in his initial position with one's own Rajah, is even
							more valuable, and quadruples its value (20 points). Note that if the <i>Rajah</i> is
							rescued in any way, with the rescued <i>Rajah</i> the advantages of <i>sinhasana</i> are lost;
							this is not the case in the promotion of a pawn, for in that case a new <i>Rajah</i> is
							appointed.</li>
						<li><b>End game by <i>Rajah</i> capturing</b>: When both enemy <i>Rajahs</i> have been captured
							and also all its pawns, and thus both enemy armies are definitly frozen, the number of final
							turns can be limited, for example to five turns, that is to say ten moves for each remainding
							player; this rule is to avoid a never-ending end.</li>

				<p>The Sanskrit word चतुरङ्ग (chaturanga) in Middle Persian or Pahlavi, loses the 'u' per
					syncopation and the final 'a' by apocope (chatrang: چترنگ). For this reason, the
					name <b><i>Chatrang</i></b> is usually reserved for the Persian version, which in
					turn gave rise to the Arabic version, the <b><i>Shatranj</i></b>.
				</p>
				<p>There is a <a href="http://www.avesta.org/pahlavi/chatrang.htm" class="cite" target="_blank"><b>text
							in Middle Persian (Pahlavi)</b>
						<q cite="http://www.avesta.org/pahlavi/chatrang.htm"><i>Explanation
								of Chess and arrangement of Vin-Artakhshir</i></q></a>
					concerned with the earliest story of the invention
					of the games of chess and backgammon in the
					sixth century, during the rule of the great
					Sasanian king of kings, <i>Khosrow I</i> (501-579 CE, king from 531).
					In addition, other Middle Persian texts mention the game of chess and
					backgammon in a context that makes it clear that it was part of the courtly
					education. <q><i>Khusro ud Rēdag</i></q> (<q>Khusro and the Page</q>)
					refers to to the same period, but
					<q><i>Kārnāmag ī Ardaxšīr ī Pābagān</i></q>
					(<q>Book of the deeds of Ardashir, son of Pabag</q>) references them
					at the time of the creation of the Sassanid empire (beginning of the
					third century), but this text, however, appears to be a late compilation
					dated on the seventh century, probably during the reign of <i>Khosrow II</i>.
				</p>
				<p>The text, well known for its later inclusion in the
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahnameh" class="cite"
						target="_blank"><q><i>Shahnameh</i></q></a>,
					the national epic of Persia, written and compiled by
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdowsi" class="cite" target="_blank">Ferdowsi</a> around
					the year 1000,
					explains the arrival of <i>Chatrang</i> from India as an oriental tale,
					although it reserves the creation of <i>Nêw-Ardaxshîr</i>, which soon
					gave rise to <i>Nard</i>, which in turn was later transmitted to India
					and is the precedent of <i>Backgammon</i>. The latest dating of the
					original text places it at around 600 CE, coinciding with the earliest
					archaeological evidence of chess in Iran, an elephant cut in black stone
					dated to the end of the 6th or 7th century. A brief
					<b><a href="http://history.chess.free.fr/sources.htm" class="cite" target="_blank">adapted
							translation of the text</a></b>
					is copied here:
				</p>
				<blockquote cite="http://www.avesta.org/pahlavi/chatrang.htm"
					class="w3-container w3-pale-blue w3-leftbar">
					<p>
						<i>Dêwisharm</i> (<i>Divsaram</i>), an Indian king <small>identified to
							<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharvavarman" class="cite" target="_blank"><i>Deva
									S´arvavarman</i></a>, a king
							of <i>Kanauj</i> from the <i>Maukhari</i> dynasty, by <i>Renate Syed</i>,
							professor of Sanskrit</small> sent its vizier, <i>Tâtarîtos</i>
						(<i>Takhtritus</i>), to
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khosrow_I" class="cite" target="_blank"><i>Khosrow I
								Anôshag-ruwân</i></a>
						(immortal soul), Shâh of Persia, with many presents:
					</p>
					<p><q>A set of 16 emerald and 16 ruby pieces, 90 elephants and 1200 camels charged with
							gold, silver, jewels, pearls and rainment</q>.
					</p>
					<p>A challenge accompanied this caravan:</p>
					<p><q>As your name is King of the Kings, that means that your wise men should be wiser
							than ours. Either you discover the secrets of this game, or you pays tribute</q>.
					</p>
					<p><i>Khosrow</i> asked for few days to solve the enigma. The last day,
						<i>Bozorgmehr</i> rose and says to his king:
					</p>
					<p><q>I shall solve this game easily and secure revenue and tribute from <i>Dêwisharm</i>
							and I shall prepare another thing and shall send it to <i>Dêwisharm</i> which he
							shall not be able to solve and I shall exact double the tribute from him;
							and be you sure of this that you deserve the emperorship, and the wise men
							here are wiser than those of <i>Dêwisharm</i></q>.
					</p>
					<p>He called <i>Tâtarîtos</i> before him and said:</p>
					<p><q><i>Dêwisharm</i> made this game of chess like war. He made the Kings (<i>Shâh</i>)
							like two overlords, the Ministers (<i>Mâdayâr</i> or <i>Rox</i>) essential for the
							left and the right flanks, the General (<i>Frazên</i>) to resemble the chief of the
							warriors, the Elephant (<i>Pîl</i>) to resemble the chieftain protecting the rear,
							the Horse (<i>Asp</i>) to resemble the chief of the horsemen, and the Pawns
							(<i>Payâdag</i>) to resemble the foot-soldiers on the battlefront</q>.
					</p>
					<p>Then <i>Bozorgmehr</i> proposed to the <i>Khosrow</i> to send to <i>Dêwisharm</i> a
						game of his invention, the <i>Nêw-Ardaxshîr</i>, <q>brave-Ardashir</q> thus named
						in the honor of <i>Ardashir</i>, the founder of the dynasty. This game used
						15 black and 15 white pieces on a table inspired by the movement of the stars and
						the cycle of the days.
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Tha%27alibi" class="cite"
						target="_blank">al-Tha'alibi</a>, when the Arabs entered
					<i>Ctesiphon</i>, the capital of the Sassanid empire of Persia, they found
					some ruby and emerald chess pieces that belonged to <i>Khosrow II</i>.
					The text is to be understood in a context in which backgammon is seen as a superior
					game: while the game of chess is a game linkened to battle, backgammon is based on
					the throw of the dice, thus based on one’s fate. According to some of the
					traditions of Zoroastrianism in the Sasanian period, fate dominated and controlled
					human life. An annotated translation can be found at:
					<a href="https://www.academia.edu/42833344/On_the_Explanation_of_Chess_and_Backgammon_Abar_Wiz%C4%81ri%C5%A1n_%C4%AB_%C4%8Catrang_ud_Nihi%C5%A1n_N%C4%93w_Ardax%C5%A1%C4%ABr"
						class="cite" target="_blank">On the Explanation of Chess and Backgammon</a>.
				</p>
				<p>In the text, the Persians have to guess the rules of the game, which <i>Bozorgmehr</i>
					succeeds, and then he won three games against <i>Tâtarîtos</i>. The great symmetry
					of the movements of the pieces (see the drawing attached to the
					<a href="#Xatranj" class="cite">Shatranj</a>) makes me personally think of some
					alteration of the chaturanga rules, and I am thinking in particular of the movements
					of the <i>elephant</i>; It is true that the movement of the <i>chariot</i> is not
					known either, but the conjecture that the movement was maintained is very solid.
				</p>
				<p>Persia, just before the beginning of the reign of <i>Khosrow I</i>, welcomed the
					scholars of the <i>Platonic Academy</i> (<i>Neoplatonic Academy</i>), which was
					closed by <i>Justinian I</i> in 529. Throughout the Middle Ages Persian mathematics
					were an important contribution within the Islamic world, and throughout the West,
					but it is also true that at the time theological and transcendent meanings were
					sought in symmetries and geometry.

					<p>The name of the elephant (<i>Fil</i>) has been preserved in Catalan as <i lang="ca">Alfil</i>,
						but also in Spanish, Italian, Turkish and Persian; in Russian the word <i lang="ru">слон</i>
						(<i>elephant</i>) is used directly. In addition, the name <i>Ferz</i> has been preserved
						in Russian (<i lang="ru">Ферзь</i>) for the <i>Queen</i>, and as <i>vezér</i> in Hungarian.
					</p>
					<p>These philological roots in Russian words, directly linked to Persian, together with other
						archaeological evidence, are considered proof of the Persian connection of chess in Eastern
						Europe, specifically among the Slavs.
					</p>
					<p>In Russian the name Elephant (<i lang="ru">слон</i>) is kept for the <i>bishop</i>, and
						interestingly since ancient times the name <i lang="ru">Ладья</i> (<i>ship</i>), instead of
						the original version <i>chariot</i>, is used for <i>rooks</i>, which could be justified by
						the Varangian influence and the importance of ships for this culture. Nevertheless it
						should be noted that the ship type does not refer to a Viking <i>drakkar</i>, but to a
						Slavic vessel.
					</p>
					<p>Chess was called <q><a href="#Zaquitrion" class="cite">zaquitrion</a></q> in the Eastern
						Roman empire, a name that philological evidence has established, apparently with certainty,
						as a Hellenisation of the Persian <i>Chatrang</i> rather than the Arabic <i>Shatranj</i>.
						This Persian origin of the word <q><i>Zaquitrion</i></q> may allow us to date the
						knowledge of the game in Byzantium probably earlier than 661 CE, when in Persia the
						invaders imposed Arabic as a language on their subjects throughout the Umayyad empire;
						although Middle Persian proved to be very durable, if it had occurred at a later date,
						for example, if it was already in the Abbasid dynasty (750 CE), it would be natural
						to observe a provenance from Arabic, particularly considering that the Arabs quickly
						appropriated the game, and the importance they attached to chess.

					</div>
				</figure>

				<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shatranj" target="_blank" class="cite">Shatranj</a>
					(Arabic: شطرنج; Persian: شترنج) was the evolution of the <i>Chaturanga</i> in Persia, and from
					there it reached the Arab world around the year 530, a hundred years before the
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_conquest_of_Persia" target="_blank"
						class="cite">Muslim conquest of Persia</a>. It is documented by means of
					references in Arabic from the medieval period, but it is unknown if, as the Arabic documentation
					assures, it coincides exactly with the version that was played in Persia.
				</p>
				<p>The game, unlike the Indian <i>Chaturanga</i>, is well documented.
				</p>
				<ul class="icon iconGrid">
					<li>The board continues to be monocolor.</li>
					<li>The pieces were: <b>Shah</b> (equivalent to king),
						<b>Firz</b> (Ferz, vizier, in Persian, medieval <i>Queen</i>),
						<b>Fil</b> (elephant, in Persian, early medieval <i>Comes</i>, <i>Curvus</i> or
						<i>Bishop</i>. It also took the name of <i>Archer</i>, and in other countries
						<i>Hunter</i> or it preserved the name <i>Al-fil</i>), <b>Asb</b> (<b>Faras</b>)
						(horse, in Persian, in many medieval countries took the name of <i>Knight</i>),
						<b>Ruhk</b> (chariot, in Persian, modern <i>Rook</i>) and <b>Sarbaz</b> (soldier,
						in Persian, later translated into arab as <b>Baidaq</b>, modern <i>Pawn</i>,
						without initial double move, and which, reaching the eighth row, promoted
						<i>Ferz</i>).
					</li>
					<li>The <i>Shahs</i> are positioned facing each other, unlike the initial position
						of the <i>Chaturanga</i>, and, of course, there was no castling.
					</li>
					<li>Therefore, the <i>Firz</i> (<i>Ferz</i>, vizier, in Persian), who play
						<a href="glossary.html#Debilitatdecolor" class="cescacs" target="_blank">colorbounded</a>,
						cannot capture each other; move one square diagonally.
					</li>
					<li>The <i>Phil</i> (elephant, in Persian) jumps two positions diagonally
						in either direction. Same as the <i>Nauca</i> (<i>Boat</i>) of the <i>Chaturaji</i>.
						In addition to be <a href="glossary.html#Debilitatdecolor" class="cescacs"
							target="_blank">colourbounded</a>, the squares it could reach were even more
						limited, only one eighth of the board. More over, the reachable squares of the four
						<i>Elephants</i> in the game were disjunct, so that one's own <i>Elephants</i> were
						complementary, reaching between them only one quarter of the board, and it was not
						possible to capture an opponent's <i>Elephant</i> with an <i>Elephant</i>.
					</li>
					<li>The end of the game occurred in three different cases:
						<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
							<li>Capturing the <i>Shah</i> (<a href="glossary.html#EscacMat" class="cite"
									target="_blank">checkmate</a>)</li>
							<li>Leaving the opponent with no possible moves (<i>stalemate</i>) was also a
								victory; if you think <i>stalemate</i> as a <q>capturing the <i>Shah</i></q>
								approach, if a <i>shah</i> in <i>stalemate</i> position moves, it will be
								captured.</li>
							<li>Stripping the <i>Shah</i>: Capturing all the opponent's pieces, apart from
								the <i>Shah</i>, meant victory, except if the opponent could capture the last
								opponent's piece on the next move, in which case the game ended in a draw.</li>
						</ol>

								(ca. 822 CE)</span>
					</h4>
					<p>The arrival of the <i>Xatranj</i> in Cordoba is attributed to
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziryab" class="cite" target="_blank">Ziryab</a>
						(<span lang="ar">أبو الحسن علي ابن نافع</span>
						<span lang="ar-Latn">Abu l-Hasan Ali ibn Nafi</span>), also known by the nickname
						of <q lang="es"><b><i>Mirlo</i></b></q> (spanish for <i>Blackbird</i>),
						a freedman of black descent, who arrived in Algeciras in 822 CE. He came from the
						court of Baghdad to reside at the court of <i>Abderraman II of Córdoba</i> (792-886).
						He was a Muslim poet, musician, singer, aesthete and gastronome who introduced many
						customs and fashions into the society of the time, many of which still persist today.
						He also established the first music conservatory in the Islamic world, and perfected
						the lute by adding a fifth string.
					</p>
					<p>Although it cannot be confirmed with certainty that he was the protagonist of the
						introduction of the <i>Sharanj</i> at the court of Córdoba, his great influence on
						that court and, in general, on the society of the emirate, allows us to affirm this
						without much room for error. He initiated them into the fashions and customs of
						Baghdadi civilisation, which they accepted as rules of social and urban conduct,
						even in such intimate aspects as hygiene and cleanliness and others linked to their
						own morals and language. Eastern forms of protocol were introduced, and society
						itself changed many customs in line with the new norms and fashions.

						(<span lang="ar">مُرُوج ٱلذَّهَب وَمَعَادِن ٱلْجَوْهَر</span>

							<p>This was a <i>Shatranj</i> played with dice, moving a piece according to
								the type of piece determined by the value of the die (6=Shah, 5=Firz,
								4=Elephant, 3=Horse, 2=Roc, 1=Peon) on a rectangular board consisting
								of 16×4 squares, which often appeared behind the board game of Nard
								(backgammon). We note that, indeed, chess in the Middle Ages was a game
								of chance and gambling.
							</p>
							<p>There were several alternative initial setup positions. In case of check,
								if the die did not allow the <i>Shah</i> to move, the player lost the
								turn, and the game was only lost when the <i>Shah</i> was captured, or
								all pieces except the <i>Shah</i> were captured.

							<p>This <i>Shatranj</i> used a board of 10×10 squares, adding two pieces to
								each player. It is the oldest known <q>decimal</q> chess (on a 10×10 board).
								Two variants are recorded:
							</p>
							<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
								<li>Incorporating a piece (four, two each player) which he calls
									<i>Dabbābah</i> (war machine), which in this case had the same moves
									as the <i>Shah</i>.
									<p class="note">The <i>Dabbābah</i> piece appears in different variants
										throughout history, with different movements.</p>
								</li>
								<li>Incorporating a piece called <i>Camel</i> (four, two each player) which
									in this case seems to move by jumping orthogonally to the third square,
									complementing the diagonal movement of the <i>Elephants</i>. This
									movement is not as limiting as that of the <i>Elephant</i>, and allows
									it to reach a quarter of the squares, so that the four disjointed
									<i>Camels</i> would reach the whole board, but without being able to
									capture each other.
									<p class="note">It is also the case that the <i>Camel</i> appears in
										different variants throughout history, but its movement is typically
										different from this one, while this movement is sometimes linked to
										the <i>Dabbābah</i>, leaving for the <i>Camel</i> a movement similar
										to the <i>Horse</i> (<i>Knight</i>), but more elongated (3×1 and 1×3
										instead of 2×1 and 1×2).</p>
								</li>
							</ol>
							<p>This <i>Shatrang at-Tâmma</i> had some different rules from the
								<q><i>ortodox</i></q> <i>Shatranj</i>:
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li>The Pawn promotes to a <i>Ferz</i>, but if the player has not yet lost
									its <i>Ferz</i>>, the extant <i>Ferz</i> is seized by the opponent.</li>
								<li>If a <i>Shah</i> successes to reach the starting square of the opposing
									<i>Shah</i>, the player obtains an half-victory.</li>
								<li>A bare <i>Shah</i> is not losing. He must continue to play.</li>

							<p>Circular chess has to be understood simply as a
								<a href="#Xatranj" class="cite">Shatranj</a> played on a circular board.
								The Arabs called it <q><i>Shatranj ar-Rumiya</i></q> (Byzantine chess) or
								<q><i>Shatranj al-Muddawara</i></q> (circular chess), and it consisted of
								64 squares, organised in four concentric rings with 16 squares each. Only
								two rules need to be considered, due to the circular topology of the board:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>The pawns are promoted by advancing six squares, reaching the row where 
									the opponent's figures closest to this pawn are positioned at the start.
								</li>
								<li>Two opposing <i>pawns</i>, <i>pawns</i> of opposing players, placed on
									the same ring and consecutive squares, can be removed on the next turn,
									without counting as a move.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Documents in the British Library and elsewhere suggest that circular chess
								was played in Persia as early as the 10th century CE, and other references
								are found in India, and later, in Europe.
							</p>
							<p>It should be noted that the <a href="#LlibreDelsJocs" class="cite"><q>Libro
								del ajedrez, dados y tablas</q> of <i>Alfonso X</i> of Castile</a>, written
								in the 13th century, does not mention circular chess; it can be deduced that
								at least then it was not very relevant, neither to Europe, nor to the Arab
								scholars, who were the main source of the manuscript of <i>Alfonso X</i> of
								Castile, and of whom we do not have many references either.
							</p>
							<p><i>Ibn al-Khatib</i>, a poet, writer, historian, philosopher and politician
								from Granada who lived in the 14th century, with a family of Yemeni origin
								who arrived in al-Andalus in the 9th century, documents the creation of
								circular chess, which he claims is traced to a manuscript from the year 618
								found in Istanbul, which describes a round, circular chess set called
								<i>Rumi</i>, the invention of which he attributes to
								<i>Abu Ali Ibn Rashiq al-Murci</i> (d. 694). The term <i>Rumi</i> comes from
								the word the Arabs used to designate the territories of the Roman Empire, and
								the circular chess is often mentioned as <q><i>Shatranj ar-Rumiya</i></q>
								(Byzantine chess) in Arabic works.
							</p>
							<p>The earliest and most valid reference is that of <i>Al-Massudi</i> (10th century)
								in his encyclopaedic work on world history
								<q><i>Meadows of Gold and Mines of Gems</i></q>, and it may be relevant that
								he called it <q><i>Shatranj ar-Rumiya</i></q> (Byzantine chess), although there
								is no other historical evidence linking the name to Byzantium, other than the
								name given by the Arabs and some much later Arabic legend.

							<p>Circular chess gives the <i>Shatranj</i> greater dynamism, providing
								more power to the <i>rooks</i>, but unfortunately, losing a little
								power to the knights. It is not an optimal solution, and for this
								reason it has not stood the test of time, as the complexity of the
								circular chessboard does not provide sufficient improvements: it forces
								the creation of two fronts, but it boxes the pieces more, delimiting
								much more their area of influence, except for the rooks. It increases
								the power of the rooks, but slightly reduces that of the knight (¼),
								and the mobility of the bishop, making the game more unbalanced. In
								addition, the absence of corners makes checkmate more difficult to
								achieve, so that probably most games ended up with the <i>king</i>
								<i>stripped</i>, or in a draw, a much less <q>artistic</q> ending than
								in the traditional <i>Shatranj</i>.
							</p>
							<p>The <q>modern</q> version of the <i>circular Shatranj</i> is <i>circular
								chess</i>, incorporating the movement of the modern <i>Bishop</i> and
								<i>Queen</i>, but, unfortunately, the <i>Bishop</i>'s movement is
								greatly impaired by the change from a square checkerboard to the circular
								version. The <i>Queen</i>, consequently, also has a disadvantage in its
								diagonal moves, but it has already been said that the orthogonal moves
								of the <i>Rooks</i> gain in power, and therefore also that of the
								<i>Queen</i> is compensated; we can think of the situation with three
								pieces of orthogonal move each player, in a checkerboard that has only
								four rows, with the diminished power of the <i>Knight</i> and <i>Bishop</i>.
							</p>
							<p>This is not to say that it is not a perfectly playable game, moreover, with
								the advantage that there are no great studies on openings, as in orthodox
								chess, allowing a pleasant game for practising chess without the
								considerations linked to the studied openings, and with a different
								approach, which is why it is practised in many clubs, particularly in
								England. But probably the behaviour is preferable as <i>Shatranj</i> rather
								than modern chess.
							</p>
							<p class="note">Turning the circular chess hobby into a competition means going
								back to the study of openings, and then the more <q>relaxed</q> condition
								of the game is lost.
							</p>
							<p>In addition to incorporating the modern <i>Bishop</i> and <i>Queen</i> move,
								there are some additional rules to take into consideration in the modern
								version of circular chess:
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li>The initial position of the pieces changes with respect to the traditional
									version, so that the two <i>kings</i> face each other (see the difference
									in the <i>circular chess</i> picture with respect to that of the
									<i>Al-Muddawara</i>).
								</li>
								<li>Although the double movement of the pawns is incorporated, there is no
									<i>en passant</i> capture, nor is there castling.
								</li>
								<li>The rules of modern chess apply to the end of the game: a stalemate is a
									draw, and there is no victory if the <i>King</i> is left naked, with
									no pieces.
								</li>
								<li>Pawns are promoted after moving six squares from their starting position
									to the square immediately before the opponent's starting line.
								</li>
								<li>The rule of <i>circular Shatranj</i> that allows <i>opposing pawns</i>
									to be removed does not apply.
								</li>
								<li>Announcing the check is not compulsory, and it is allowed to capture the
									opposing king if he does not retreat from a check position, winning the game.
								</li>
							</ol>
							<p>The modern version incorporates the queen power: there are only four rings, and
								three orthogonal move pieces for each player. It can also be criticised that
								modern long-range diagonal moves are not clearly visualised on the circular board,
								and may not be obvious.
							</p>
							<p>The <i>fondness</i> for modern circular chess lies in the great differences, both
								in the openings, which are not studied, and in the endgames. The basic endgames
								in circular chess are: king and queen; king, rook and minor piece or king and
								three minor pieces against king. The endgame king and pawn against king always wins,
								provided that the king cannot capture the pawn before it promotes or is defended.
								Checkmate is more difficult to achieve, and many games that would be lost in
								orthodox chess because of the difference in material end in a draw.

							<p>Although not much information remains, partly because it was a game intended
								to be guided by some <q>erudite</q> of the time with some knowledge of
								astrology, it seems that the game called <b><i>Escaques</i></b> detailed by
								<i>Alfonso X</i> in the <q>Libro de los juegos: acedrex, dados e tablas</q>
								of 1283 could almost be the transcription of <i>al-Falakîya Shatranj</i>, a
								game for seven players on a circular board divided into seven concentric
								rings, each one for one of the celestial bodies (in order: Moon, Mercury,
								Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn), the innermost one for the Moon, and each
								of the rings divided into small sectors as squares. But <i>Alfonso X</i> also
								indicates that he does not leave the complete information, because it should
								only be available to wise men.
							</p>
							<p>The different rings did not have the same number of squares, the numbers being,
								in order from the inside: 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72 and 84. In addition, the
								innermost circle, inside the moon ring, is divided into four, for the four
								elements: fire, air, water and earth. The seven tokens, one for each celestial
								body, had stipulated colour and shape, for example, for the <i>Moon</i>, the
								token was to be represented by <q>A woman dressed in white, and with her hands
								above her head holding the figure of the moon</q>, <i>Mars</i> a classical
								soldier, or <i>Venus</i> a woman with a mirror and a comb.
							</p>
							<p>It was a gambling game <b>very unrelated to <i>Shatranj</i></b>, despite
								bearing the name. Each player started with twelve points, and the game was
								played with a seven-sided die that determined which star had to move, and
								another die indicating how many moves had to be made. The resulting position
								of the celestial body in relation to the other celestial bodies determined,
								according to rules, the winnings or losses; these rules are largely
								determined by the astrology of <i>Claudius Ptolemy</i> (100 - 170 CE).
							</p>
							<p class="note">A seven-sided die usually refers to a <i>long die</i>, or a
								<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teetotum"
								class="cite" target="_blank">teetotum</a>, eight sided, discarding one
								of the values.

						<cite>Versus de
							scachis</cite>: Beginning of western chess
					</h3>

					<p>The earliest known Western reference to chess is the Latin poem
						<q><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versus_de_scachis" target="_blank" class="cite">Versus
								de scachis</a></q>, dated to around the year 1000,
						late 10th or early 11th century. It was found on two manuscripts from
						<a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abad%C3%ADa_de_Einsiedeln" class="cite"
							target="_blank">Einsiedeln Abbey</a> Library (Switzerland).
						The <a href="https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Versus_de_scachis" class="cite"
							target="_blank">original text can be read from wikisource</a>,
						and its importance was highlighted by <b>Gamer, Helena M.</b> <q>The Earliest Evidence
							of Chess in Western Literature: The Einsiedeln Verses.</q> Speculum 29 (1954): 734 - 750.
					</p>
					<p>The <strong>name of <i>Regina</i></strong> appears in Latin, but with the medieval movements
						of the <i>Ferz</i>, also called <i>Alferza</i>, or in Latin <i>Ferzia</i>. The
						<i>Shatranj</i>'s <b>Fil</b> is referred to as <i>Comes</i> –count, but it also means companion–
						or <i>Curvus</i> –crooked, referring to an old man–; it moves (jumps) two squares diagonally.
						The <i>Rooks</i> appear as <i>Rochus</i>, but also as <i>Margrave</i>, a military title similar
						to that of<i> marquis</i>, a military governor of the frontier areas of the Roman-German Empire.
						The promotion of the <i>Pedes</i> -Pawns- allows them to become <i>Regina</i>, as long as
						the original <i>Regina</i> is no longer in play on the board.
					</p>
					<p>Either way, these expressions in the document, which have clear Latin roots, may suggest that
						chess entered the territories of the heart of Europe, either via the Italian peninsula or,
						perhaps more likely, directly from Byzantium. The Germanic title of <i>Margrave</i> also
						stands out, which is quite natural considering the location of the abbey of Einsiedeln,
						and the fact that the abbot held the title of prince of the Germanic Roman Empire since
						<i>Otho I</i> established it (965).
					</p>
					<p>The poem is also the first known reference of the
						<strong>two colored checkered board</strong>, simply as an optional aid to the players,
						without being the compulsory board pattern.

							<span>Zaquitrion: Chess in the Eastern Roman Empire</span>
						</h4>
						<p>Chess was called <i>Zaquitrion</i> in the Eastern Roman Empire, a Hellenisation of
							the Persian <i>Chatrang</i> and not the Arabic <i>Shatranj</i>, dating knowledge
							of the game in Byzantium to about the 7th century, before 700 CE.
						</p>
						<p>Unfortunately, there are no dated records of the presence of chess in the Eastern
							Roman Empire, which, moreover, is sometimes confused with
							<a href="#EscacsCirculars" class="cite">circular chess</a>, for it could be that				
							this variant was particularly popular in Byzantium, and then it is also difficult
							to determine the variant to which the few existing sources refer.
						</p>
						<p><i>Al-Massudí</i> (10th century) called <q><i>Xatranj ar-Rumiya</i></q> (Byzantine
							chess) to the circular chess or <q><i>Xatranj al-Muddawara</i></q>, although there
							is no historical evidence linking circular chess with Byzantium other than the name
							given to it by the Arabs and some much later Arabic legend. The term <q>Rūm</q>
							comes from the word the Arabs used to designate the territories of the Roman Empire,
							and circular chess is often referred to as <q><i>Xatranj ar-Rumiya</i></q> (Byzantine
							chess) in Arabic works.
						</p>
						<p>The presence of chess in the Eastern Roman Empire is known to predate
							<i>Alexios I Komnenos</i> (1048 - 1118), who is documented as a chess amateur, but
							unfortunately there are no reliable, dated earlier references.

							<q><cite>De Shahiludio: Poema tempore Saxonum exaratum</cite></q>.
							It was found in a manuscript with various contents in Winchester,
							dated before 1150.
						</p>
						<p>It is another testimony to the rapid arrival of chess in the UK, along with the
							well-known <a href="#pecesLewis" class="cite">Isle of Lewis Chessmen</a>. We

								to Hyde Abbey</a>, which is located right in Winchester, but they would have
							disappeared afterwards. This fact could be perfectly true, and it is more than
							possible that King Canute was at least aware of the existence of the game of chess.
						</p>
						<p>This poem uses the term <q><i>Regina</i></q> for the original piece, while it uses
							<q><i>Ferzia</i></q> for the crowned pawn with the characteristics of the
							<i>Regina</i>. It calls the bishops <i>Calvus</i>, representing old age and wisdom.

						<b>beginning of the 13th century (1202)</b>. It was not until late in the second half of the
						fifteenth century that the <q>messenger</q> entered chess as the modern <i>Bishop</i>.
					</p>
					<p>The first reference dates from 1202, in an Arthurian romance by <i>Wirnt von Gravenberg</i>,
						predating <i>Alfonso X of Castile</i>'s <q>El libro del ajedrez, dados y tablas</q>, and
						<q>Tamerlane's chess</q>. Later <i>Heinrich von Beringen</i> mentions <i>Courier Chess</i>
						as an improvement of chess, in the poem <q>Schachbuch</q>, from the year 1300, a verse
						adaptation in German language of the work of <i>Jacobus de Cessolis</i>. In this poem he
						clearly referred to the moves incorporated by the <i>Bishop</i>, in the form of a new piece
						called the <i>Messenger - Kurier -</i> or also called the <i>runner - Läufer -</i>.
					</p>
					<p>This variant, popular for centuries in many northern European countries, is particularly
						associated with the village of
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Str%C3%B6beck" class="cite" target="_blank">Ströbeck</a>,
						because <i>Frederick William of Brandenburg</i> gave the village a chessboard in 1651, which can
						be seen in the local chess museum. His grandson, <i>Frederick the Great of Prussia</i> visited
						the village and played this chess set in 1744. Visitors in 1825 and 1831 reported that the game
						was extinct, but the chess tradition in this village is still alive.
					</p>
					<p>This game lasted until the beginning of the 19th century, along six centuries.

						Tenía 110 casillas (10x11) y dos adicionales denominadas ciudadelas;

						incorporaba algunas nuevas:
						dos <i>espias</i>, dos <i>jirafas</i>, dos <i>dabbābah</i> y un <i>visir</i>.

						<i>Shatranj Kamil</i> (perfect chess) or <i>Shatranj Al-Kabir</i> (big chess). It had

					<p>The tradition of this chess produced the appearance of another variation on a great board

								class="cite"><cite><i><b>Scachs d'amor</b></i></cite></a></q>
						from 1474, by the Valencian poets <i><b>Bernat Fenollar</b></i>,
						<i><b>Narcís Vinyoles</b></i> and <i><b>Francí de Castellví</b></i>, is the
						oldest surviving reference to the modern rules of orthodox chess.
						<strong>All the rules of modern chess</strong>, including
						<strong><i>En passant</i> captures and moves of all pieces</strong>, appear for
						the first time in this poem, with
						<strong>the <i>Queen</i> described for the first time with her modern moves</strong>.
						He also describes the same limitations on castling in modern chess, when he describes
						the limitations on <i>King's Leap</i>, a two-square jumping move that the <i>King</i>
						could make on its first move, which evolved into <i>castling</i>, despite the fact
						that both movements coexisted for a long time.
					</p>
					<p>Even so, we find some rules concerning the <i>Queen</i> that do not apply today,
						perhaps the only discordant points with modern chess:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>You cannot have more than one <i>Queen</i> on the checkerboard (verse LVII).</li>
						<li>The queens cannot capture each other (verse LX).</li>
						<li>If the queen is lost, the game is lost (verse LXIII).</li>
					</ul>
					<p>It should be noted that the rule of
						<q><b>not allowing a player to have more than one Queen</b></q>
						was <b>common at the time</b>, for ethical reasons, since it represented
						<b>royal marriage</b>. Sometimes the stratagem of calling the first piece
						<i>Queen</i> was used, reserving the name of <i>Lady</i> when a second piece
						was obtained through promotion.
					</p>
					<p>We also see in the poem <q><cite>Scachs d'amor</cite></q> two other rules that are not
						in force today either: First, it
						<b>endows the <i>Queen</i> with a true royal character</b>
						when it is stated that <q><b>if the queen is lost, the game is lost</b></q>, but the
						<a href="glossary.html#Regalia" class="cescacs" target="_blank">royal character</a> is
						now a condition reserved for the <i>King</i> in chess, a sexist aspect inherited
						directly from history.
					</p>
					<aside style="display:flex;flex-flow:row wrap" class="w3-container">
						The chess variant <q><i>Queen of hearts chess</i></q>, proposed by <i>V.R. Parton</i>,
						consists precisely in having to keep both pieces in play, the <i>King</i> and the
						<i>Queen</i>, in order not to lose. Naturally you also have to warn the <i>Queen</i>
						of the check.
					</aside>
					<p>The third case occurs when it is indicated that
						<q><b>the queens cannot capture each other</b></q>,
						which <b>suggests a reminiscence</b> of the figure of the <i>Ferz</i>,
						inherited from the <i>Shatranj</i>, since it was a
						<a href="glossary.html#Debilitatdecolor" class="cescacs" target="_blank">colour bounded</a>
						figure, and the initial position for the white ones were white, and for the black ones,
						black. Thus, before changing the movements of this piece, the <i>Ferz</i>, already known
						in Europe as <i>Queen</i>, could not capture the opponent's, simply because she could
						not move to a square of another color. The rule incorporated in
						<q><cite>Scachs d'amor</cite></q> seems to be nothing more than transitional,
						<b>preserving a characteristic of the game of the time</b>.
					</p>
					<p>This poem, from the same date as the monarchical unification of the kingdoms of
						Castile and Aragon by the Catholic Monarchs, perhaps incorporates a certain influence
						from Isabel of Castilla as queen, despite the fact that, as has already been commented,
						a piece with the name de <q>Queen</q> had already been incorporated into European chess
						for almost 500 years. The point highlighted by the defenders of this thesis is that now
						the piece goes from being a weak piece to being the most powerful piece on the
						checkerboard. This fact may be merely coincidental, but, in any case, it could have
						contributed to the acceptance of the new piece. It must also be remembered that the poem
						uses the word <i>Lady</i> much more than the name <i>Queen</i> which had been adopted
						in France and incorporated into Latin as <i>Regina</i> for the medieval <i>Ferz</i>;
						Even so, the position on the checkerboard, next to the <i>King</i>, does not leave many
						more options to the imagination.
					</p>

						noteworthy moves, it is the first game that has been referenced using the current
						rules. <b>The full text of the poem</b> <q><cite>Scachs d'amor</cite></q>, along

					</p>
					<p>This new style of chess started in Spain was called <q>Queen's Chess</q>, but it caused
						a lot of controversy, and in different circles of enraged male players began to call it
						<q>madwoman’s chess</q>, <q>scacchi alla rabiosa</q>, they also called it
						<q>Scacchi de la donna</q> in Italy, or <q>Welsches Schachspiel</q> (French Chess) in
						Germany. Thanks to the advent of the printing press and the popularity of chess books
						at the time, the <q>Queen's Chess</q> spread quickly throughout Europe, with
						<i>Francesc Vicent</i> being the first to spread the new rules of the game.
						The appearance of some powerful women at the beginning of the Renaissance could
						also have contributed to the acceptance of the great power of the <i>Queen</i>:
						<i>Caterina Sforza</i> (1463-1509), <i>Isabella d'Este</i> (1474-1539),
						<i>Lucrezia Borgia</i> (1480-1519), <i>Caterina de Medici</i> (1519-1589).
						<b><i>Lucrezia Borgia</i></b> welcomed
						<a href="#FrancescVicent" class="cite"><i>Francesc Vicent</i></a>,
						and <b><i>Isabella d'Este</i></b> welcomed <i>Leonardo da Vinci</i> and <i>Luca Pacioli</i>,
						who dedicated the chess book <q><i>Schifanoia</i></q> to her.
					</p>
					<p>Castling, together with the promotion of pawns, would be the two latest rules of chess,
						since they were not fully established until mid-17th century. The peninsula was one of
						the last places where castling began to be used, perhaps because the rules for the
						<i>King's leap</i> were already established, known both in the poem
						<q><cite>Scachs d'amor</cite></q>, and in the publication by <i>Ramirez de Lucena</i>.
						These early rules prohibited the <i>King</i> from jumping other pieces in the move,
						so castling done manually in two moves was not possible.

					</h4>
					<p>The <q><cite>Llibre dels jochs partits dels schacs en nombre de 100</cite></q>
						is the world's <b>first modern chess treatise</b>, written by
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesc_Vicent" target="_blank"
							class="cite"><i><b>Francesc Vicent</b></i></a>, a Valencian
						chess player and writer. It was published in Valencia in 1495, despite the fact
						that no copy has reached the present day. It is known that there was a copy in
						the library of the Monastery of Montserrat, but it disappeared during the
						Napoleonic invasion.
					</p>
					<p><i>Vincent</i> is considered the founder of modern chess, as his work, as far as
						is known, <b>spread throughout Europe the innovation of the <i>queen</i></b>,
						a piece that appears documented for the first time in the poem
						<q><cite><b>Scachs d'amor</b></cite></q> (1474).
						In 1506 we find another reference to <i>Vicent</i> in Italy, at the court of
						the Ferrara family. This is confirmed by the Italian master <i>A. Sanvito</i>,
						from the court of <b>Lucrezia Borgia</b>, when he mentions a
						<q lang="it"><i>maestro Francesco Spagnolo maestro di scachi</i></q>.
					</p>
					<p>Now, the Valencian researcher <i>José A. Garzón</i> argues that the codex of
						Cesena, which dates from 1502 and was found in 1995 in the Malatesta Library
						in Cesena (Italy), includes 100 problems from <i>Vicent</i>'s book, and in
						several chess problems the original writing in Valencian by <i>Vicent</i>
						survived, with expressions from València at the end of the 15th century.
						There seems to be no doubt that this treatise is the origin of other texts,
						but, in addition, it seems that
						<a href="#ReglesEscacs" class="cite">Lucena</a>'s book would be a translation
						into Castilian of <i>Vicent</i>'s original written in Valencian. The
						dependence of the treatises by <i>Lucena</i> (1497) and <i>Damiano</i> (1512)
						on <i>Vicent</i>'s work has already been pointed out. In fact, it can be
						observed that <i>Damiano</i>'s work was written in the environment of Pope
						<i>Alexander VI</i> and his sons, and <i>Vicent</i> can be placed in 1506
						at the court of <i>Lucrezia</i>, daughter of <i>Alexander VI</i>, as her
						chess teacher. The contents of <i>Damiano</i>'s book could be a reprint
						of <i>Vicent</i>'s modern chess materials.

					<p>A Latin manuscript chess treatise by <i>Luca Pacioli</i>, a mathematician of the early

						<cite>De ludo scachorum</cite>, also known as <cite>Schifanoia</cite>,
						which would come to mean <q>chasing tedium</q>, includes about a hundred chess problems,

						in the <i>Coronini Cronberg</i> palace in Gorizia (Italy). Its importance lies in the fact
						that the chess diagrams in this book were probably made by <i>Leonardo da Vinci</i>.
					</p>
					<p><i>Luca Pacioli</i> and <i>Leonardo da Vinci</i> were friends, and <i>Leonardo</i> had already

					<p>The manuscript is dedicated to <i>Isabella d'Este</i>, a princess of the duchy of Ferrara and
						Modena, a descendant of <i>Alfonso V the Magnanimous</i>, who became marquise consort and
						regent of the duchy of Mantua. <i>Isabella d'Este</i> was an outstanding humanist and patron
						of the arts, creating a brilliant court around her. She was also a prolific writer of letters,
						much of which has survived, and a great lover of the game of chess. <i>Leonardo da Vinci</i>
						painted a portrait of her.

				</figure>

				<p>Already in the 18th century, in 1749, the book <q>L'analyse des échecs</q>, by
					<i>François-André Danican Philidor</i>, was published, where strategy and the importance
					of the pawn structure in the game as a positional factor are discussed. The book describes
					the characteristics of isolated, doubled, backward pawns and pawn islands. This publication
					can be considered as the end of the first stage, the standardization stage and the first
					studies.
				</p>
				<p>Thus began the <i>romantic era</i> and the popularization of the game within an
					intellectual class that had begun to take shape in the 18th century, with chess becoming
					entertainment in the cafés of Paris in the 19th century. This stage is characterized
					by gambit openings (sacrificing pawns, or even major pieces), brazen sacrifices and
					daring attacks, playing more like an art than applying theoretical foundations.
					Players would rush out the <i>Queen</i> and fail to develop the other pieces,
					launching a quick attack on the opponent's <i>King</i>. The defense was poor and
					without deep planning.
				</p>
				<p>This romantic approach to the game did not end until the late 19th century, after 1873,
					when <b>Wilhelm Steinitz</b> described how to avoid weaknesses in one's position, and
					how to create and exploit these weaknesses in one's opponent's position; a practical
					approach, outside of the showiness or elegance that had been valued so much until then.

				<p>It is considered that <b>in 1886 the first world championship was played</b>,
					which <i><b>Steinitz</b></i> won; in 1894 he was won by the mathematician
					<i><b>Emanuel Lasker</b></i>, who held the title for 27 years. Cuban

						target="_blank"><b>José Raúl Capablanca</b></a> beat <i>Lasker</i>
					in 1921; <i>Capablanca</i> did not lose any game in the tournaments that he
					participated between 1916 and 1924. <i>Capablanca</i> lost the title in 1927
					against the Russian, later French national, <i>Aleksandr Alekhin</i>, who always
					avoided the revenge game.
				</p>
				<p><i>Capablanca</i> used a style which embodies the concept of <i>positional chess</i>;
					for example, <i>Capablanca</i> would often take a small endgame advantage and use it
					to win a game. Coming out of the concept of positional chess was hypermodernism, or
					the idea of controlling the center with pieces, not just pawns. The idea arose in the
					1920s, and some examples of hypermodern openings include <i>Grünfeld</i>, <i>Benoni</i>,
					<i>Indian</i> and <i>Alekhine</i> defenses, among others. <i>Alexander Alekhine</i>
					was thought of as both a tactical and positional player.
				</p>
				<p>After <i>Alekhin</i>'s death in 1946 the title became vacant. Since then, the
					title has been a string of Soviet, later Russian, players, with the exception
					of the American player <i><b>Bobby Fischer</b></i>, from 1972 until renouncing
					the title in 1975. Soviet-Russian dominance ended in 2007.

						the rook and king endings; he was the first true wit capable of playing chess,
						albeit in a very limited way.

					<p>The first software capable of participating in a complete game began with the work of
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon#Shannon's_estimate_for_the_complexity_of_chess"
							target="_blank" class="cite">Claude Elwood Shannon</a> en 1949, in 1949, who
						estimated the possible moves in a game of chess at 10<sup>120</sup>, the number of

						<q><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search" target="_blank" class="cite">brute
								force</a></q>; we must think that the
						number of atoms in the entire universe is considered less than 10<sup>80</sup>.
						<i>Shannon</i> also gave the first indications to build a software capable of playing,
						limiting the depth of the investigation in the
						<a href="https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax" target="_blank" class="cite">minmax</a>
						tree of possibilities, and determining its value by means of a heuristic function.
					</p>
					<p>The 1970s ended with small personal computers that were already capable of achieving
						an acceptable level for an average player, but still far from master levels, not
						even using large computers; but the expectations of when a machine would be able to
						defeat a great champion were already beginning.

						is not based on human knowledge, and its understanding of the game, outside of the

			<p><cite><a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajedrez_de_Capablanca" target="_blank"
						class="cite">Capablanca
						Chess</a></cite> is an extension of orthodox chess invented in 1920 by <b>José Raúl
					Capablanca</b>. It
				uses a checkerboard of <em>eight by ten squares</em>, and introduces two new pieces: the
				<a href="#Canceller" class="cescacs"><em>Chancellor</em></a> and the
				<a href="#Arquebisbe" class="cescacs"><em>Archbishop</em></a>.
			</p>
			<p>These pieces, but with different names, had already been introduced in the 17th century by
				<i>Pietro Carrera</i> in 1617. Also <cite>Bird's chess</cite>, dating from 1874, used the same pieces,
				but with other names. Already in 1984, <cite>Grandiose Chess</cite> defines a larger board,
				ten by ten, with specific initial positions, and once again the names of the two new pieces
				of <cite>Capablanca's Chess</cite> are changed, calling them <i>Mariscal</i> and <i>Cardenal</i>.
				In the year 2000 <cite>Gothic Chess</cite> is defined as a variant of <i>Capablanca Chess</i>
				that only differs by the initial positions of the pieces.
			</p>
			<p>Interestingly, we can observe a version of this game in each of the four stages in which we have
				divided the history of modern chess: Establishment of the modern game (<i>Pietro carrera</i>),
				romantic age (<i>Bird</i>), establishment as a sport (<i>Capablanca</i>) and the chess automation,
				with an ineffective first attempt at <i>Grandiose Chess</i>, but eventually taking up
				<i>Capablanca</i>'s
				ideas with <i>Gothic Chess</i>.

			<p><i>Hexagonal Chess</i> is a variant of chess that is played on checkerboards made up of hexagonal-shaped
				cells,
				which we will call <i>hexes</i>. It was invented by <b>Władysław Gliński</b> in 1936. This chess variant
				is
				known by the generic term <q><i>Hexagonal Chess</i></q>.
			</p>
			<p><a href="#Wellisch" class="cite">Sigmund Wellisch</a>, as early as 1912, presented a hexagonal chess
				for three players, but the <a href="glossary.html#MovimentDiagonal" class="cescacs"
					target="_blank">diagonal moves</a> were not yet defined.
				<b>Lord Baskerville</b> is considered the author, in 1929, of the first hexagonal version of chess,
				despite
				the fact that it was only a prototype.
			</p>
			<p>In 1936 <b>Władysław Gliński</b> solved the problems that had arisen in the <b>Baskerville</b> prototype,
				presenting a new design. <i>Hexagonal Chess</i> now had a hexagonal checkerboard in the form of a
				regular hexagon of six <i>hexes</i> per side, with a total of 91 <i>hexes</i>, for which <i>Gliński</i>
				established an algebraic notation. Each player had three <i>bishops</i>, one for each color, and all
				<i>pawns</i> were equidistant from the promotion.
			</p>
			<p>In addition, <i>Gliński</i> studied cases where the <a href="glossary.html#Promocio" class="cescacs"
					target="_blank">promotion of a <i>pawn</i></a> is inevitable, the
				<i>opposition</i>,
				the <a href="glossary.html#Matboig" class="cescacs" target="_blank">fool's mate</a>, and the
				<a href="glossary.html#Final" class="cescacs" target="_blank">endings</a> with <i>Queen</i>,
				with <i>Rook</i>, with two and with three <a href="glossary.html#Peçamenor" class="cescacs"
					target="_blank">minor pieces</a>. The game had been carefully designed.
			</p>
			<p>The new game took a while to spread, due to the war, and they were presented publicly at the 1951
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festival_of_Britain" class="cite" target="_blank">Festival of
					Britain</a>. It was finally a huge success in the 1970s.

				</figure>

				<p>The checkerboard in the form of a <em>regular hexagon with 91 hexes</em> is formed with <i>hexes</i>
					of three different colors, so that the <i>hexes</i> of the same color do not touch. <i>Gliński</i>
					named the colors <em><i>light</i></em>, <em><i>dark</i></em>, and <em><i>medium</i></em>, with the
					medium color remaining for the central hex; thus, there are <b>30 <i>light</i> hexes</b>,
					<b>30 <i>dark</i> hexes</b> and <b>31 <i>medium</i> hexes</b>. Sometimes fans have used two colors,
					such as blue and red, in addition to white, but although this color scheme is more in line with the
					later <cite>McCooey variant</cite>, the choice of colors does not affect gameplay. Even so, an
					<i>official</i> checkerboard will have the <b><i>middle</i> color</b> in the <i>central hex</i>.
				</p>
				<p>The eleven columns are named using the letters of the Latin alphabet, from <q>A</q> to <q>L</q>, as
					the letter <q>J</q> is missing, to avoid confusions. The oblique rows are numbered from <q>one</q>
					to <q>eleven</q> on both sides, using the numbering of the oblique rows in one direction on the
					left side of the checkerboard, and the oblique rows in the other direction on the right,
					thus dividing the checkerboard by the central column for numbering.
				</p>
				<p>The pieces are the same as in orthodox chess, with the addition of a <i>pawn</i>, and a <i>bishop</i>
					for the additional color. The movement of the pieces is defined in a perfectly equivalent way to
					orthodox chess, once the
					<a href="glossary.html#MovimentOrtogonal" class="cescacs" target="_blank">orthogonal movements</a>
					are defined as the six movements that follow the six directions of the sides of a hex, and the
					<a href="glossary.html#MovimentDiagonal" class="cescacs" target="_blank">diagonal movements</a>
					as the movements that follow the directions of the six vertices, following hexes of the same color.
					This perfect equivalence is broken by the case of the <i>Pawn</i>; for the correspondence with
					orthodox chess, they would have to correspond to three movements of capture, and
					one <q>and a half</q> movements without capture.
				</p>
				<p>The movement of the <i>Pawn</i> is defined by a single movement of one hex forward, following
					the row of its column, with the option of moving two hexes when it is in the starting positions,
					regardless of whether it has been moved. They have two capturing moves, defined as forward oblique
					orthogonal moves, and this means that a pawn that has made a capturing move can end up in a
					starting position of another <i>pawn</i>, despite having already made a capturing move. Since
					double movements are defined for the pawns, the <i>en passant</i> capture is also defined.
				</p>
				<p>The initial position of the pieces leaves the three <i>Bishops</i> in the central file, and the
					<i>pawns</i> in a wedge, actually forming a
					<a href="glossary.html#EstructuraPeons" class="cescacs" target="_blank">structure</a>
					of defended pawns between them, with the property that thus all the pawns remain at the same
					distance from the promotion. What is most strange when you see the arrangement for the first time,
					is that there are empty hexes between the pawns and the rest of the pieces, this being an important
					feature in the early development of the game.

					<p>Between 1978 and 1979, despite the then recent creation in 1976 of the
						<a href="#BHCF" class="cite" target="_blank">BHCF</a>, <b>Dave McCooey</b> and
						<b>Richard Honeycutt</b> developed another hexagonal chess variant also using a
						checkerboard of 91 hexes, although <i>McCooey</i> claims that, at the time they
						designed the game, he did not know about hexagonal chess (from Gliński).
					</p>
					<p>The <cite><i>McCooey</i> variant</cite>, in a certain way, we could define it as one
						that questions the movement of the pawns established by <i>Gliński</i>; the capture
						of the pawns is now defined with a diagonal movement, much more intuitive and close
						to orthodox chess, at the cost of losing a large part of the pawn game.
					</p>
					<p>It is also necessary to point out that it has a more compact initial arrangement of the
						pieces, but for this reason it loses some interesting maneuvers that exist in the
						<cite><i>Gliński</i> chess</cite> openings, and it also incorporates two less pawns
						for each player, seven, instead of nine. The central pawn, on the <i>F-column</i>,
						lacks a double move, to avoid favoring <i>White</i> on the initial move.
					</p>
					<p>The reason for the capture movement of the pawns, <i>Gliński</i> had studied carefully,
						and it is the need to achieve a <a href="glossary.html#EstructuraPeons" class="cescacs"
							target="_blank">pawn structure</a> without leaving rows between
						them that allow an attack with pieces of orthogonal movement, the equivalent of
						orthodox chess, where the holes that left in pawn structures only allow diagonal access.
						Even so, <cite><i>McCooey</i>'s variant</cite> is very playable, because the power of
						the pieces in a 91-hex hexagonal chess quickly develops, and we soon enter the
						middlegame.
					</p>
					<p>The more compact initial setup allows more mobility in the center, and some distance
						of the pawns from the opponent's, but in the quick entry into the middlegame
						<i>Gliński</i>'s setup incorporates some almost positioned, chained pawns, while
						in the version of <i>McCooey</i>, in addition to having fewer pawns, loses the power
						that the ability to close rows using pawn structures provides. It can also be seen
						that the initial setup in the <cite><i>McCooey</i> Variant</cite> leaves the F-pawn
						initial position undefended, a point that is particularly sensitive to a knight attack.

					<p><b>Valeriy Trubitsyn</b> introduces
						<cite><a href="http://www.fishka.spb.ru/artickles/englishversion/ENGLISH/1.htm" target="_blank"
								class="cite">Hexofen</a></cite>, which follows the rules of the
						<cite><i>McCooey</i> variant</cite> for the pawn capture move. This time a third
						<i>Knight</i> and eleven <i>Pawns</i> are introduced in an initial layout of
						the pieces, so that the <i>Pawns</i> cover all the columns, but are at different
						distances from its promotion hexes.
					</p>
					<p>The interest of this variant lies in the incorporation of more <i>pawns</i>, and
						their distribution over all the columns of the checkerboard, similar to how
						orthodox chess or <cite><i>Shafran</i>'s hexagonal variant</cite> does it.
						<b>Trubitsyn</b> gives importance to the ratio of pieces, which is 0.46 (42/91),
						in the same way as <i>Shafran</i> had done, but the proportion of pieces probably
						has to correspond to the new topology and different mobility, and as an example
						we can think of the situation of the <i>bishop</i>, which is balanced with the
						introduction of a <i>third bishop</i>, but the rest of the pieces increase the
						power and mobility by a factor of 150%, almost the same as the size of the
						checkerboard increases, up to 91 hexachecks (142%). Even so, it is true that in
						hexagonal chess the number and behaviour of the <i>pawns</i> is very questionable,
						and in this case the number of pawns has been tried to be balanced, but opting for
						the diagonal capture, which does not increase the power of the pawns to the same
						extent as the other pieces, nor their mobility, in addition to the drawback of the
						<i>pawn structures</i>, which has already been discussed in the description
						of <cite><i>McCooey</i>'s variant</cite>.
					</p>
					<p><b>Trubitsyn</b> defines a numbering of the hexes by dividing the checkerboard into
						three parts, and each hex is numbered depending on the part to which it belongs,
						using zero for the (oblique) rows that delimit the zones; thus we find that the
						common rows have a double denomination:
						A‹0,5› = C‹5,0›, A‹5,0› = E‹0,5› y E‹5,0› = C‹0,5› ; not only for the value
						<q>five</q> in this example, but for all the <q>zero</q> rows defined between the
						centre and one of the corners. This way of numbering does not introduce any
						advantages, although it is true that it is symmetrical for three views of the
						checkerboard, but not for the two positions of the players. This configuration
						betrays its use for a three-player game, the
						<cite><a href="#Diplomat" class="cescacs">Diplomat</a></cite>, where this
						numbering is very useful.

							<ul>
								<li>Therefore, <i>en passant</i> capture occurs all over the board,

						</li>
						<li>When the movement of the pawn is made from the <b>initial positions</b> it allows the

								<li>The reason for limiting the <i>triple move</i> on the <i>F-central column</i>

						<li>The solution to the problem of the <a href="glossary.html#EstructuraPeons" class="cescacs"

						<li>The <b>number of <i>pawns</i> is thirteen</b>, with the important reinforcement of

					<p>But perhaps one of the most characteristic features of <i class="cescacs">C'escacs</i> is
						that it incorporates classic

						</figure>
						<p>The ratio is an indicator of board occupancy. It must be considered that in
							a hexagonal board all the pieces, except the pawns and the bishops, increase their
							mobility and power by 150%. We can make a compensation to equalize conditions, where
							we will equate the three bishops to the orthodox chess pair, and we provide an
							increase of 150% for the rest of the pieces, to calculate a compensated ratio.
						</p>
						<p>In <i class="cescacs">C'escacs</i> we find six pieces of great power, three for each
							player. Despite the fact that the hexagonal <i>Pegasus</i> is much less powerful
							than <i>Capablanca's Archbishop</i>, the <i>Dragon</i> is equivalent to a
							<i>Queen</i>. To compensate for these six additional pieces of extraordinary power,
							four points are added to the number of pieces compensated.
						</p>
						<p>Compensating for <i>pawns</i> is much more complex and we'll avoid it, but you have
							to remember that it generally loses the mobility of ½ moves and one capturing move,
							in addition to its inability to build <i>pawn structures</i>;
							Not so in the case of <i>Gliński</i>, where it is possible to develop
							<i>strong pawn structures</i>, and the loss of power
							and mobility is compensated by trading diagonal captures for orthogonal pawn captures.
							But it is very difficult to numerically assess these trade-offs; in the case of
							<i class="cescacs">C'escacs</i> we can add the <i>Elephants</i> to the number of
							<i>pawns</i>, and considering that the power is greater, we can make a compensation
							by counting each <i>Elephant</i> as two <i>pawns</i>; but the increased mobility of
							the pawns is not considered.
						</p>
						<p>We observe that the <cite>Shafran variant</cite> preserves the ratio of pieces in play,
							but does not consider the increase in mobility and power, which occurs except for
							<i>bishops</i> and <i>pawns</i>, which decrease. The table shows the
							<q>compensated value</q>, as an approximation of these factors. So, the <i>Gliński</i>
							and <i>McCooey</i> variants conform to orthodox chess values, followed by also very
							closely adjusted value by <i>Hexofen</i>.
						</p>

						<p class="note">These calculations are only estimates, and it is easy to find arguments
							to refute them. A low ratio for <i class="cescacs">C'escacs</i> is not surprising,
							since the board is very large.

				<p>In hexagonal chess, all the pieces increase their mobility and capture power by ½, except
					<i>bishops</i> and <i>pawns</i>, which do not increase, but decrease, with the exception of
					<i class="cescacs">C'escacs</i>, which increases the mobility of <i>pawns</i>, though not the
					capture moves. The pointed orientation of the hexes
					(<a href="https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#diagram-spacing" class="cite" lang="en"
						hreflang="en" target="_blank">pointy topped</a>) does not leave
					<a href="glossary.html#Columna" class="cescacs" target="_blank">vertical columns</a>,
					but horizontal rows and <a href="glossary.html#Linia" class="cescacs" target="_blank">vertical
						lines</a>. <i>Pawns</i> cannot advance in a
					straight line along a column, but this allows to increase the mobility of pawns in two
					directions, doubling the mobility.
				</p>
				<p>The capture is also generally defined by the two hexcaques
					<i><a href="glossary.html#MovimentDiagonal" class="cescacs" target="_blank">moving diagonally
							forward</a></i>,
					that is, the hexes of the same color in the next horizontal row. Thus the number of
					capturing moves is not increased, but all four moves leave the pawn on the next horizontal
					row, defining the movement of the pawns very conveniently similar to orthodox chess, and
					the double mobility could be said to balance the fact that there is no capture movements
					increase.
				</p>
				<p>Initially <i>De Vasa</i> defined three capturing positions for the pawns, also increasing the
					capturing moves by ½, including the hex defined by the forward-in-front diagonal move, thus
					advancing two horizontal rows in the capturing. But this move had to be removed in a later review
					of the game, because it made the pawns excessively powerful, in addition to the asymmetry that he
					introduced by advancing two positions in this move instead of one.

				<p>There are also some three-player variants that claim to be <q>hexagonal chess</q>. But, besides
					reminding us that the term should not be used in such a crude way, the intervention of
					<i>diplomacy</i> between the players makes us refer to another type of game, and perhaps
					the classification as <q>chess</q> is comparable to
					<b><a href="#Xaturaji" class="cite">Chaturaji</a></b>, where even with the participation
					of chance, as it is played with dice, the four players play in pairs, thus balancing the
					intervention of diplomacy. In my opinion, games for more than two players cannot be classified
					as <q>chess</q>, even if they are inspired by chess.
				</p>
				<p id="Wellisch">
					Actually <b>Sigmund Wellisch</b>, as early as 1912, designed hexagonal multiplayer chess,
					although the hexagonal moves of the pieces were not yet perfected, as the hexagonal
					<i>Bishop</i> had not yet been defined; the <i>Knight</i>'s move was equivalent to a
					medieval <i>Queen</i> in a hexagonal board, and its <i>Queen</i> combined this move
					with the orthogonal move of the <i>Rooks</i>.
				</p>
				<p>One case that has recently gained some popularity is <cite>Jacek Filek's Chess</cite>.
					<b>Jacek Filek</b>, of Polish nationality, has marketed two board versions of his
					<q>three-player chess</q>.

				<p>There are several multiplayer games derived from chess in China:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><q>Qiguo Xiangqi</q> (七國象棋),
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_the_Seven_Kingdoms" target="_blank"
							class="cite"><q>The Game of the Seven Kingdoms</q></a>,
						a chess-inspired game for up to seven players, although fewer players can also play.
						In this game, asking for help from an opponent who is not part of one's alliance
						requires the player to drink a shot of liquor. The game dates back to the
						11th century, and was designed by the imperial minister and historian
						<i>Sima Guang</i> to commemorate the
						<q><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Warring_States" class="cite"
								target="_blank">Seven Warring States</a></q> (<i>403–221 BC</i>).
						Like all chess (and related games) from the Far East (China, Japan, Korea,
						even Vietnam), it is played using lines to move the pieces, and vertices
						to place them. But <i lang="zh-CN">響尾蛇的數學天地</i> (<i>Sanke</i>)
						version on a heptagon with a hexagonal tessellation
						<small>which can be seen in the illustration</small> is played using the
						tessellations, the hexes, to position the pieces, as in western chess.

						<span>Bughouse Chess</span>
					</h4>
					<p>This variant is particularly popular, as it makes for an entertaining game of
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bughouse_chess" class="cite" target="_blank">chess in
							pairs for four players (Bughouse chess)</a>.
						It is played on two boards, and the pieces captured by your partner on the other board
						can be incorporated into your game instead of moving a piece, always without checkmated
						when incorporating the new piece.
					</p>
					<p>Commentary is allowed between players on the same team, and the game is generally played
						with a clock (two clocks, one for each board), in blitz or rapid games, where the pawns
						do not promote, and are removed from the board when they reach the eighth rank. There
						may be variants of the game, but the most frequent when playing blitz games is that
						winning on one of the two boards means victory for the pair of players, and the game
						is over.
					</p>
					<p>Probably, among multiplayer chess, it is the variant that remains closest to chess, as
						multiplayer variants always involve a <i>Diplomacy</i> component, which in the
						<cite>Bughouse Chess</cite> variant remains under control; <cite>Bughouse Chess</cite>
						is possibly the multiplayer variant that most preserves the spirit of chess.

							target="_blank">Diplomat</a> (<b>Valeriy Trubitsyn</b>, 1997), is a
						<a href="#Hexofen" class="cescacs">Hexofen</a> variant, a chess game played on a
						hexagonal checkerboard of 91 hexes, to make it a three-player game. The strange
						numbering of the board now makes sense, and seems useful. Each of the three players
						incorporates: <i>King</i>, <i>Queen</i>, four <i>Rooks</i>, three <i>Knights</i>,
						three <i>Bishops</i>, but only eight <i>Pawns</i> (<i>Hexofen</i> uses eleven).
						In total sixty pieces, twenty from each player, on a board of 91 hexes.
					</p>
					<p>The initial arrangement of the three players is symmetrical using <i>Trubitsyn</i>'s
						notation:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>White</strong>:
							K-a55, Q-a54, R-a35, R-a53, R-a42, R-a52, N-a34, N-a33, N-a32, B-a45, B-a44, B-a43.
							Pawns: a25, a24, a23, a22, a21, a31, a41, a51.
						</li>
						<li><strong>Black</strong>:
							K-c55, Q-c54, R-c35, R-c53, R-c42, R-c52, N-c34, N-c33, N-c32, B-c45, B-c44, B-c43.
							Pawns: c25, c24, c23, c22, c21, c31, c41, c51.
						</li>
						<li><strong>Color</strong>:
							K-e55, Q-e54, R-e35, R-e53, R-e42, R-e52, N-e34, N-e33, N-e32, B-e45, B-e44, B-e43.
							Pawns: e25, e24, e23, e22, e21, e31, e41, e51.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The <i>pawns</i> now incorporate the <b>three
							<a href="glossary.html#Movimentortogonal" class="cite" target="_blank">orthogonal moves</a>
							forward</b>, and <b>four capture moves in
							<a href="glossary.html#Movimentdiagonal" class="cite" target="_blank">diagonal
								movement</a></b>,
						two forward and two sideways. The first move of the pawns is allowed to be a double, and
						<a href="glossary.html#Promocio" class="cescacs" target="_blank">promotion</a> is given in
						the <strong>four hexes of the two opponent's vertices</strong>: 45, 44, 55, 54; in total,
						eight different promotion hexes for each player.
					</p>
					<p>In <i>Diplomat</i> the aim is to "mate" the opponent's kings,
						and the different possible outcomes are set out:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>0.66 points for each player, when all three players make a draw overall.</li>
						<li>1 point for the two players who make a draw, but have won in alliance against
							the third player.</li>
						<li>0.66 points for the player who draws with the player who has mated the
							third player.</li>
						<li>1.33 points for the player who draws after having checkmated the
							third player.</li>
						<li>2 points when one player beats the other two players.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Once a player is defeated, the pieces remain immobile in the places where they
						had been, but the game also leaves open the variant where the pieces of the
						defeated player, except for the <i>King</i>, remain the property of the winning
						player, as does <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_the_Three_Kingdoms" class="cite"
							target="_blank">Sanguo Qi (三國棋)</a>.
					</p>
					<p>There will be a problem in determining whether the first player to lose has
						been defeated by only one of the players or by both, both in terms of dividing
						the points and in terms of taking possession of his pieces if this rule is
						played. Diplomatic pacts are part of the game, and common strategies can be
						established by players passing each other papers with notes:
						<q>diplomatic couriers</q> with different degrees of alliance (duration).
						Perhaps these notes can be used as a test of alliance to resolve conflict
						casuistries when defeating the third player.

						<i>Queens</i> are placed in the center of the row and <i>Kings</i> on its sides,
						so that each <i>King</i> can only castle <q>short</q> on its side, and there are
						no <q>long</q> castle. <i>Pawns</i> can move up to three steps on their first

						and now behaves as just another piece, and if the opponent captures it, the game
						goes on. The object is to <b>capture all the opponent's <i>Pawns</i></b>; if a
						<i>Pawn</i> reaches the back rank it promotes to a <i>Knight</i>, and the player
						loses one of his valuable <i>Pawns</i>. When a player runs out of <i>Pawns</i>,
						he loses the game; if it is Black, he can make one last move, and if he also

					</li>
					<li><b><i>Mock chess</i></b>: Similar to <i>Imperial Fiddlesticks</i>, but <b>all

						<p>Simply having a larger board is not enough to significantly increase complexity,

						</h4>
						<p>A very popular game among the ancient Egyptians and often depicted in tombs, the earliest
							examples
							found date from <b>pre-dynastic Egypt</b>, around 3100 BCE. Instead of dice, the Egyptians
							used flat
							sticks with two different sides, one blank and the other black or decorated, sometimes also
							using
							a pair of tiles (as in the <i>game of ossicles</i>) instead of the sticks. The pieces are
							similar
							to some chess pieces, such as pawns and rooks. The game has points in common with other more
							modern games such <i>Game of the Goose</i>, <i>Backgammon</i> or <i>Parcheesi</i>.

						<p>The <i>game of five lines</i> is a <b>Greek</b> board game of the <i>Tables game</i> or

							<span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_men%27s_morris" class="cite"
								target="_blank">Nine men's morris (1st century CE)</a></span>
						</h4>
						<p>The game, or one very similar to it, is quoted in <i>Ovid</i>'s <cite>Art amatòria</cite>
							(1st century CE). The <b>African</b> connections of the game of alquerque could determine
							that the game <i>Ovid</i> refers to is either a different game, or that the African games
							predate this date.
						</p>
						<p>Other three main alternative <b>variations of the game</b> are <i>three</i>, <i>six</i>, and
							<i>twelve men's morris</i>; The latter in turn has two different variants, depending wether
							it has a central position, then named <b><i>Alquerque</i></b>, or not, like the
							<i>Morabaraba</i> in Africa. Quite popular during the Middle Ages, <i>three</i>,
							<i>nine</i> and <i>twelve</i> (<i>Alquerque</i>) variants appear in <i>The Book of Games</i>
							commissioned by <i>Alfonso X</i> of Castile. It also appears on numerous reliefs in medieval
							England and later appears in <i>William Shakespeare</i>'s <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i>.
						</p>
						<p>The number of possible positions is about 10<sup>10</sup>, resulting in about 10<sup>50</sup>
							possible games. In 1993, <i>Ralph Gasser</i> solved the game and proved that it ends in a
							draw,
							assuming perfect players.

								target="_blank">Seega</a> (10th century CE)</span>
						</h4>
						<p>We have references to the <i>Alquerque</i> (or <i>twelve men's morris</i>) since the
							10th century, but it is with <i>Alfonso X</i>'s
							<a href="#LlibreDelsJocs" class="cite">El Libro de los Juegos</a>, in the 13th century,
							that we get the rules. It seems that <i>Alquerque</i> would be the
							<b>precedent of the current <i>game of draughts</i></b>, which would appear in combination
							with the checkerboard of chess. It is known that the game was brought to Europe by the Moors
							when they entered the Iberian Peninsula. Different versions on the board throughout Africa
							confirm the origin of the game in the Sub-Saharan Africa, dating back to at least the early
							Middle Ages. <i>Seega</i> is a version that was very popular in Egypt throughout the
							19th and 20th centuries.

							<span><a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hnefatafl" class="cite"
								target="_blank">Hnefatafl (400 CE)</a></span>
						</h4>
						<p><i>Hnefatafl</i> is a board game that belongs to the family of <i>tafl</i> games, ancient
							Germanic board games played on a gridded table and which are probably descended from the
							Roman <i>Ludus Latrunculorum</i>. The <b>Vikings</b> considered a good game of
							<i>Hnefatafl</i>
							or <i>King's Board</i> to be a sign of nobility. Some versions of this game were popular
							in Northern Europe from at least 400 CE until they were replaced by chess during the
							Renaissance. The descriptions of the rules of this family of games are confusing, but the
							game has been reconstructed as it must have been played in antiquity.

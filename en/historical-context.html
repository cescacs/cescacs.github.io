        <p>The introduction of the game coincided with the <q><b><i>High Middle Ages</i></b></q>,
            just before the <i>Late Middle Ages</i>, which began with the crisis of the 14th century.
            It was then that the last and most prominent <b>medieval periods of the renaissance</b>
            took place, with the most notable influences on chess being the Ottonian renaissance
            (continuation of the Carolingian), and the Gothic pre-renaissance of the 12th century,
            with the revitalisation of trade, the emergence of the bourgeoisie and the consolidation
            of the Christian kingdoms. The period was interrupted in the 14th century by the Black Death
            epidemic.
        </p>
        <p>The spread of the <i>Shatranj</i> in Western Europe is
            <a href="http://history.chess.free.fr/first-european.htm" class="cite" target="_blank">archaeologically
                present in several places</a>.
            In the 10th century the luxury pieces were mainly of glass, of Muslim manufacture,
            and the simpler ones of bone. Beginning in the 11th century, the
            <b>pieces again took on a figurative form</b>, as they had done in Persia before the
            Muslim domination. In the 12th century figurative pieces began to become common, but
            they still shared space with abstract symbolic ivory pieces, that now incorporated
            engravings, sometimes decorative, but the tendency was to represent the meaning of
            the piece. Thus, in the 13th century the symbolic pieces characteristic of the Islamic
            <i>Shatranj</i>, still present in Europe until the end of the 14th century,
            practically disappeared.
        </p>

        <p>In the <b>Late Middle Ages</b>, and after overcoming the crisis caused by the Black Death
            in the 14th century, the reform of the game in the 15th century coincided with the
            emergence of the rich merchants and the bourgeoisie, patronage and the
            <b>prelude to the Renaissance</b>. The nobility lost importance in favour of the king and
            the courtiers, so that soon the knowledge of the game was part of the knowledge required
            of a courtier, emulating the indications of the ancient Muslim sages.

                    <p>The <b><i>Medieval period of warming</i></b>, also known as the
                        <i>Medieval climate anomaly</i>, was associated with an unusual temperature
                        rise roughly
                        between <b>950 and 1250 CE</b>. For about 300 years, these new climate
                        conditions changed
                        ecosystems and radically altered human societies.
                    </p>
                    <p>As northern Europe became warmer, the cultivation boundaries were higher and
                        further north,
                        so agriculture spread and generated <b>food surpluses</b>. At the time,
                        England was warm
                        enough to support vineyards, centralised governments in Europe were becoming
                        stronger,
                        people no longer needed fortifications to protect their once limited arable
                        lands, and many
                        people left seeking new lands.
                    </p>
                    <p>With sea ice and land ice in the Arctic shrinking with the rising
                        temperatures, new lands
                        became accessible and <b>Vikings</b> travelled farther north than before.
                        The <b>expansion of the Norse culture</b> across Iceland into southern
                        Greenland, and their
                        ultimate establishment of isolated settlements in Newfoundland, occurred
                        during this time.
                    </p>
                    <p>The early 13th Century marked the beginning of the <b>conquests of <i>Genghis
                                Khan</i></b> and
                        his Mongol hordes. An abundance of moisture would seem to provide the
                        horsepower for the
                        rapidly growing Mongol Empire. The Mongol soldier typically had five steeds
                        at their disposal.
                        With a large army, that quickly translates into huge herds and a huge need
                        for grass.

                    <p>The importance of the monasteries in producing copies and translations of
                        existing classical works
                        is well known. The invasions of the Western Empire by the Nordic peoples that
                        began in the early
                        5th century destroyed the imperial libraries spread over much of Italy. Many of
                        their volumes,
                        containing the great Latin classical tradition, were preserved in private
                        libraries. Important
                        repositories of classical books together with Latin ecclesiastical texts were
                        established in
                        Christian communities.
                    </p>
                    <p>Throughout the Middle Ages, from the foundation of
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Cassino" class="cite"
                            target="_blank"><b>Montecasino</b></a> (529) until the 15th century, the
                        libraries
                        of Western Europe were exclusively ecclesiastical, belonging to monasteries or
                        cathedrals, and, from
                        the 13th century onwards, to universities. The Benedictine rule, with its
                        prescriptions obliging
                        reading and writing, laid the foundations of the <i>scriptorium</i> and the
                        library that existed in
                        all the monasteries that the order spread throughout Europe.
                    </p>
                    <p>It is in the monasteries that we find the <b>first reference to chess</b> in the
                        West,
                        <q><i>Versus de scachis</i></q>, in the Benedictine abbey of <b>Einsiedeln</b>
                        (Switzerland),
                        with strong links to the <b>Ottonian dynasty</b> of the Holy Roman Empire, who
                        had a relationship
                        with <i>Gerbert of Aurillac</i>, <b>Pope <i>Sylvester II</i></b>, who studied at
                        the
                        <b>Monastery of Santa Maria de Ripoll</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p>With almost no communications in the Late Middle Ages and very little in the High
                        Middle Ages,
                        communications between monasteries were very important, and translations from
                        the monastery of Ripoll
                        were used, for example, in the abbey of Reichenau, on Lake Constance. We must
                        think that practically
                        until the beginning of the 12th century, and the revitalisation of trade in the
                        13th century, the usual
                        mode of travel was between monasteries, rather than between towns.
                    </p>
                    <p>The situation in the East dragged on for a few centuries, and from
                        <i>Constantine</i> to <i>Justinian</i>
                        several libraries were organised, in Asia Minor, Alexandria, Palestine, Athens,
                        the monasteries of Mount
                        Athos, and above all, the <b>Imperial library in Constantinople</b>. These
                        libraries suffered multiple
                        fires and invasions, usually destructive. The imperial library was the most
                        important, with some 100_000
                        copies. But after two major fires in the 5th and 8th centuries, it was plundered
                        by the Croatian Franks
                        and Venetians during the Fourth Crusade in the early 13th century. The Imperial
                        Library, a centre for
                        the preservation of mainly Greek writings, disappeared definitively with the
                        invasion of Constantinople
                        in the 15th century, although it is still the most important source of Greek
                        classics that have survived
                        to the present day.
                    </p>
                    <p>Even considering the importance of Constantinople, with an important task of
                        conservation and copying of
                        manuscripts for their preservation, it was not an important centre for the
                        generation of new documents,
                        nor for the dissemination of existing ones, as it did not have a school or
                        university, and there is no

                        and its scholars
                        persecuted by Justinian. The <b>contents generated by the Eastern Roman Empire
                            since Justinian were very
                            meagre</b>. For example, chess is considered to have been played in
                        Constantinople, and some testimonies
                        attest to this, but references are practically non-existent. By the 10th
                        century, Damascus, Baghdad or
                        Córdoba were of greater cultural importance, as they had accumulated most of the
                        originals, which were
                        copied in Arabic, and were the centres of cultural production and dissemination.

                    <p>The <b>Sassanid empire (226-651)</b> had three centres of education, at
                        Ctesiphon, Resaena, but mainly
                        the <i>academy of Gundeshapur</i>, which became the intellectual centre of the
                        empire in the time of
                        <i>Khosrow I</i>, offering refuge to the Hellenistic intellectuals of the
                        Neoplatonic school of Athens,
                        persecuted by <i>Justinian I</i> in 529. This school also made many translations
                        into <i>Pahlavi</i>,
                        <i>Sassanid Persian</i>.

                        in fact, the academic centre of Baghdad drew on the scholars of Gundeshapur,
                        beginning the rapid decline
                        of the Persian academy. The <q>Great Library of Baghdad</q> is considered the

                        of Islamic thought
                        during the <b>Golden Age of Islam</b>. Its scholars also acted as civil

                        architects and political advisors, among others. It was destroyed by the Mongols

                    <p><b>From the 9th century onwards</b>, an important
                        <b>network of libraries spread throughout the Islamic world</b>:
                        Baghdad, Cairo, Alexandria, Cordoba, Toledo and Granada. The <b>library in
                            Cordoba</b> had as many as
                        400_000 copies in the 10th century, while the Cluniac library in the 11th
                        century had only a few hundred
                        volumes; hence the great importance of the <i>Toledo School of Translators</i>
                        in the 12th and 13th
                        centuries, who translated many Arabic manuscripts.
                        Many Jews also acted as translators, and thus would be a transmitter of the
                        cultural and scientific legacy
                        of the Arab world to both Jews and Christians. In the West, the work of
                        <i>Alfonso X of Castile</i>, mainly
                        a compendium of knowledge of Muslim origin, is well known, as the Islamic
                        contents concerning the
                        <i>Shatranj</i> and other games were quite extensive, mainly from writers of
                        Persian origin.
                    </p>
                    <p>As early as <b>the 13th century</b>, Paris was the first city to have a large
                        commercial exchange of
                        manuscripts, with manuscript producers commissioned to make specific books for
                        specific people. Paris had
                        a large population of wealthy literate people, enough to support the people who
                        produced the manuscripts.
                        This medieval period marked the shift in manuscript production from monks in
                        monasteries to booksellers
                        and scribes who made a living from their work in <b>the cities</b>. In the 11th
                        and 12th centuries chess
                        became popular among monks, nobility and clergy, but in the 13th century there
                        are references to its use
                        by crusading soldiers, thus being a further factor in the game's arrival among
                        the wealthy merchants and
                        cultivated professionals who began to appear in the cities.
                    </p>
                    <p>The <b>13th and 14th centuries</b> brought a profound change to medieval
                        libraries. <b>Universities</b> and
                        university libraries appeared, although they did not really come into their own
                        until the Renaissance.
                        Private book collections increased greatly. In Italy, the first humanists,
                        <i>Petrarch</i> (1304-1374),
                        <i>Boccaccio</i> (1313-1375) and, especially, <i>Poggio Bracciolini</i>
                        (1380-1459), travelled through the
                        ancient abbeys and interacted with merchants from the East in search of
                        classical Greek and Latin texts.

                    <p>Many Islamic cities were great centres of knowledge and prosperity, and there was
                        great religious tolerance,
                        so that travel to Damascus, <b>Baghdad</b>, and <b>Cordoba</b> was common. These
                        could be considered
                        cultural journeys, and the prosperity of these cities encouraged many to take up
                        residence, with frequent
                        conversions of immigrant Christians to Islam; a simple <b>phenomenon of cultural
                            and economic immigration</b>
                        to the rich, cultured and developed cities of Islam.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the 10th century, during the time of Caliph <i>Abd-ar-Rahman III</i> (891-961)
                        and his son
                        <i>Al-Hakam II</i> (915-976), al-Andalus enjoyed unprecedented economic and
                        cultural splendour, with its
                        centre in Córdoba. There was a high degree of tolerance so that philosophers,
                        scholars, artists and
                        scientists of various origins entered his courts. <i>Al-Hakam II</i> created
                        <b>the richest and most
                            important library in Europe in Córdoba</b>. Translators translated thousands
                        of Greek and Latin works into
                        Arabic. The caliphate, which became an important state at the end of the reign
                        of <i>Abd-ar-Rahman III</i>,
                        maintained diplomatic relations with the Byzantine Empire and the Holy Roman
                        Empire. The caliph maintained
                        a permanent delegation in Baghdad to copy or acquire any volume that could be
                        published, and also maintained
                        relations with delegations in Constantinople, Alexandria and Damascus, cities
                        also very rich in culture,
                        which enabled him to continue to enrich the <b>library in Córdoba</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p>During the 11th and 12th centuries, many Christian scholars travelled to Muslim
                        lands to learn science.
                        Prominent examples are <i>Leonardo Fibonacci of Pisa</i> (1170 - 1250),
                        important mathematic, and
                        <i>Adelard of Bath</i> (1080 - 1152) who made Latin translations of many
                        important Arabic scientific works,
                        including ancient Greek texts that only existed as translations in Arabic, and
                        were thus introduced to Europe.
                        Another case was <i>Constantine the African</i> (1017 - 1087), one of the
                        introducers of Arabic medicine to
                        Europe. In the 11th to 14th centuries many European students attended Muslim
                        centres of higher learning,
                        similar to Western universities.

                    <p>Another motive for Christian visits to Islamic lands was pilgrimages to the
                        <b><i>Holy Land</i>, Palestine</b>.
                        <i>Constantine I</i> in 330 moved the capital of the empire to Byzantium, and
                        built Christian places of worship
                        in Jerusalem, such as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. In 603, <i>Pope Gregory
                            I</i> commissioned the
                        construction of a hospital in <b>Jerusalem, which was part of the Eastern Roman
                            Empire</b>, to serve and care
                        for Christian pilgrims in the Holy Land (a hospital was then a type of hostel).
                        In 614 the Sassanid Empire
                        conquered Jerusalem, until it was recaptured in 629 by Emperor Heraclius, but
                        Byzantine Jerusalem was finally
                        <b>conquered by the Arabs in 638</b>. In 800, Charlemagne enlarged the Jerusalem
                        hospital, and added a library.
                    </p>
                    <p>From the 4th century onwards, <b>new pilgrimage routes were established through
                            the lands of the Eastern Roman
                            Empire</b>, routes that had not been common until then, as Christians had
                        been persecuted. These routes for
                        many centuries represented an <b>important cultural flow through
                            Constantinople</b>. Later, towards the end
                        of the 11th century, these routes were used for the Crusades.
                    </p>

                        They had different variants, with
                        the facility of often still existing Roman roads, including bridges to cross the

                    <p>It was generally in the 11th century that far-reaching commercial activities,

                        began to resume.
                        The <b>pilgrimage routes began to be protected by the kings of Christendom</b>,
                        which encouraged them to be

                    <p>The earliest recorded case of prohibition is the <b>529 CE</b> ordinance issued
                        by
                        <i>Emperor Justinian</i> of the Eastern Roman Empire, when he closed the
                        Neoplatonic Academy and

                        This was a few years before the arrival of chess in Persia, but
                        <b>the ban may have delayed the entry of chess into the Byzantine empire</b>,
                        where it was called

                        <p>In fact, the prohibition was related to the monotheistic justification of
                            polytheism made by
                            Proclus (412-485), which was maintained in the Neoplatonic school.

                    <p>Islam also had its prohibitions. In 655, <b>Caliph <i>Ali Ben Abu-Talib</i>
                            banned chess</b> because
                        the pieces had idol figures on them. <b>In 680 Islam interpreted the rule as
                            forbidding chess</b>,
                        although the Caliphs themselves played chess and had chess players in their
                        court.

                    <p>Around 1061 <b class="w3-text-red"><i>Peter Damian</i></b> wrote to <i>Pope

                        <q><b><i>dishonest, absurd, libidinous, and a distraction from the duties of the

                    <p>By the year 1093, shortly after the <q>Great Eastern Schism</q> (1054), the
                        Eastern Orthodox Church
                        condemned chess. The Church eradicated chess in Russia as a vestige of paganism.
                    </p>
                    <p>Around 1115, the emperor <i>Aleix I Comnè</i> was fond of the game. Despite this,
                        it was still
                        censored in the Eastern churches until 1125. <i>John Zonares</i>, a monk who had
                        been captain of

                    <p>Another reason for the reluctance to chess in the West may have been its

                    <p>From the end of the 11th century to the 13th century there was the phenomenon of
                        <b><i>the crusades</i></b>, military campaigns, armed pilgrimages and the
                        establishment
                        of new Christian kingdoms, which also had the indirect effect of cultural
                        exchanges,
                        but the forced character determined by circumstances brings them closer to the
                        spoils
                        of war; chess pieces of rock crystal or ivory were often used as embellishments
                        for
                        other pieces, and, despite references, no set of pieces with precious gems has
                        been found.
                    </p>
                    <p>Although many nobles travelled to the lands of Palestine, the phenomenon slowed
                        down the
                        exchanges that generated trade and peaceful Christian immigration to the lands
                        of Islam.
                        Despite this, it was instrumental in the <b>re-establishment of international
                            trade</b>,
                        and also facilitated rapprochement with some elements of Islamic culture;
                        for example, stories are told of soldiers playing chess in their free time,
                        indicating that
                        chess was already a popularly known game, and the war contributed to its
                        diffusion.
                    </p>
                    <p>It should also be remembered that crusading routes to Palestine generally passed
                        through
                        the Eastern Roman Empire and <b>Constantinople</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p>Relations between the Western Europeans (Latin or Franks in the nomenclature of
                        the time)
                        and the Eastern Europeans (Greeks) had been complicated since the
                        <b><i>Great Eastern Schism</i></b> that began in 1054, just before the beginning
                        of the
                        crusades. From then on, the Westerners had been hostile to the Easterners, as
                        was evident
                        during the First, Second and Third Crusades. These relations deteriorated
                        further in 1182
                        (before the Third Crusade), when all the foreigners in Constantinople had been
                        massacred
                        and the Venetian merchants had been expelled by the Byzantine emperors of the
                        Angelos
                        dynasty.

                        <p>In 1202 the Republic of Venice had completed preparations for the crusade,
                            which was to attack directly the heart of the Islamic world at the time,
                            the city of Cairo, on papal orders. But many embarked in other ports, and
                            only 12_000 men took part, instead of the 33_500 men budgeted for. Venice
                            demanded the full payment, 85_000 silver marks, but the Crusaders were only
                            able to collect 51_000. This left them in a state of abject poverty,
                            and an economic disaster also for the Venetians, who had stopped their trade
                            for a whole year to prepare for the expedition. The proposal was to change
                            the objective, and for the Crusaders to pay their debts by capturing the
                            Dalmatian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Zara" class="cite"
                                target="_blank">port of Zadar</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>The city had already been economically dominated by Venice in the 12th
                            century, but in 1181 it had rebelled and sought the protection of the King
                            of Hungary and Croatia. But the king of Hungary was also a Catholic and had
                            offered, at least in theory, to take part in the crusade himself.
                        </p>
                        <p>The crusaders made a pact with the emperor's brother prince and reached an
                            agreement to help him overthrow his brother. The new emperor,
                            <i>Alexios IV Angelos</i> realised that he did not have enough wealth to
                            pay for the pact, even with the destruction he carried out of priceless
                            Roman and Eastern Roman icons in order to extract the gold and silver.
                            The crusaders, dissatisfied, rioted, and much of the city was burned.
                        </p>
                        <p>Eventually the Greeks assassinated <i>Alexius IV Angelo</i>, and the new
                            emperor <i>Alexios V Doukas</i> denied the pact with the crusaders and
                            Venetians, who
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sack_of_Constantinople" class="cite"
                                target="_blank">sacked Constantinople</a>. According to a pre-arranged
                            treaty, the empire was distributed between Venice and the crusading leaders,
                            and the <b>Latin Empire</b> was established (1204), and it lasted until
                            Constantinople was reconquered by the Eastern Roman Empire in 1261,
                            which largest rump state is named <i>Empire of Nicaea</i>.

                    <p>In the early Middle Ages, before the year 1000, Europe was a land
                        of political unrest and lack of security, with a subsistence
                        economy and little movement of goods. Trade was mainly a local
                        phenomenon with no long-distance routes, leaving these activities
                        in the hands of the <b>Eastern Roman Empire</b>, which traded by
                        sea, and above all the <b>Muslim world</b>. Urban markets began
                        to enliven internal economic life from the 9th and 10th centuries
                        onwards, and from the 11th century onwards the first fairs
                        increased internal and external trade. The purchasing power of
                        the more powerful sectors of the population was greatly increased,
                        and they were attracted by luxury goods from the East.
                    </p>
                    <p>Pilgrimages and crusades would play a very important role in this
                        <b>commercial renaissance</b>, which would manifest itself in the
                        extension and renewal of routes and the volume, number and quality
                        of goods, in the appearance of the first armed associations of
                        merchants, and in the appearance of new fairs and fixed markets.
                    </p>
                    <p>In addition to the <b>sea routes</b>, there were some
                        <b>land and river routes</b> in continental Europe, many of which
                        are thought to date back to Charlemagne, although there is no
                        written record before the 11th century, when they were of great
                        importance in the <b>Ottonian renaissance</b>, the growth of the
                        <b>maritime republics</b> of the Italian peninsula, and the
                        <b>pre-Renaissance Gothic period</b> of the 12th century.

                    <p>The <b>Iberian peninsula</b> was undoubtedly the main gateway of
                        the <i>Shatranj</i> into Europe, as a consequence of the Muslim
                        presence on the peninsula
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_conquest_of_Spain" class="cite"
                            target="_blank">from the beginning of the 8th century</a>
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconquista" class="cite" target="_blank">until the end
                            of the 15th century</a>.
                        Even so, it must be understood that in the 9th, 10th, and much of
                        the 11th centuries, the contact of the Christian kingdoms of the
                        peninsula with the rest of Europe was generally too distant to
                        maintain a fluid cultural exchange.
                    </p>
                    <p>It was practically with the death of <i>Almanzor</i> and the appearance
                        of the <i>Taifa Kingdoms</i> that the timid European contacts of
                        <i>Sancho III of Pamplona</i> began, at the end of the 10th century
                        and the beginning of the 11th century. Prior to this, <b>the Asturian
                            and Vascona resistance was so isolated that it even kept itself
                            culturally separated from the Islamic world</b>, its enemies.
                    </p>
                    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camino_de_Santiago" class="cite"
                            target="_blank"><b>Way of St. James</b></a> was an
                        important bridge for cultural exchanges with Europe, but its
                        beginnings at the European level can be dated to the 10th century,
                        with the pilgrimage of some clerics and bishops. The great expansion
                        and popularisation took place in the 11th century, coinciding with a
                        more favourable political environment after the
                        <b>death of <i>Almanzor</i></b>, and the construction of hospitals
                        and improvements to the paths and roads began. The construction of
                        the current cathedral of Santiago began in 1075, the last stone was
                        laid in 1122 and the cathedral was consecrated in 1128.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>At the end of the 11th century the kingdom of Castile incorporated
                            Toledo</b>, which by the 12th century had become an important
                        cultural centre, coinciding with the <b>authorities' support for the
                            <i>Pilgrim's Way to Santiago</i></b>, protecting pilgrims. In
                        the 13th century there was already a large infrastructure associated
                        with <i>the Way</i>, the influx of nobles increased, and the cultural
                        return to the peninsula was already quite significant. After the first
                        years of religious coexistence, with the appropriation of Arabic
                        writings, the <b><i>Toledo School of Translators</i></b> created at
                        the beginning of the 12th century a cultural centre of great
                        importance for the whole of Europe. This centre reached its climax in
                        the 13th century, with
                        <b><a href="#LlibreDelsJocs" class="cescacs">Alfonso X</a></b>,
                        who made a great compilation of Islamic knowledge of chess, probably
                        knowledge of Persian origin, incorporating many Castilian contributions.
                    </p>
                    <p>Thus, <b>the 12th and 13th centuries were the great cultural period in
                            Castile and León</b>, and it was mainly during the 13th century
                        that the work produced by the <i>Toledo School of Translators</i>
                        became important. In fact, although it was closed after the death of
                        <i>Alfonso X</i>, the importance of its work would be maintained over
                        the following centuries.

                    <p>At the beginning of the 9th century, during the time of the Arab invasions,
                        <i>Charlemagne</i>'s empire created the counties of Catalonia and Aragon as
                        border counties to prevent Muslim invasions; they were what was called the
                        <q>Marca Hispanica</q>, although they were a group of counties that never
                        had a common political entity. In reality, the kingdom of Pamplona was never
                        dominated, neither by the Visigoths nor by the Muslims. The county of Aragon
                        became a kingdom after the union with the kingdom of Pamplona, thus freeing
                        itself from Frankish vassalage, and at the beginning of the 11th century it
                        freed itself from the vassalage of Pamplona. Catalonia freed itself from
                        vassalage by starting the hereditary system with <i>Wilfred I</i>, and his
                        son, <i>Wilfred II</i>, at the beginning of the 10th century, no longer
                        rendered vassalage to the Franks.
                    </p>
                    <p>We find the first references to rock crystal chessmen in Catalonia, mentioned
                        in the testaments of <b><i>Ermengol I, Count of Urgell</i></b> written on
                        the occasion of the military expedition of the Catalans against Cordoba in
                        1010, which resulted in the sacking of the city. In 1056, in the will of
                        <b><i>Ermesinde of Carcassonne</i></b>, other rock-crystal chessmen are also
                        mentioned.

                                            <i>Garin the Frank</i>. They used a chess set, a gift from
                                            <i>Ibn-al-Arabi</i>, the Muslim governor of Barcelona, as a token
                                            of gratitude for the help <i>Charlemagne</i> had given him four
                                            years earlier against the Vascons, when he had to retreat
                                            through the Navarrese pass of Roncesvalles.

                                        <p>The court marvelled at the chess set, which was made by Arab
                                            craftsmen.
                                            The pieces showed signs of their Indian and Persian origin. The
                                            chessboard,
                                            forged in silver and gold, measured one metre on each side. The
                                            pieces were
                                            made of filigree precious metals, inlaid with uncut diamonds,
                                            rubies,
                                            sapphires and emeralds. Because of the brilliance it seemed to
                                            glow with an
                                            inner light that mesmerised the beholder.

                                            was started and Garin triumphed and received as a reward the

		<p>The first talks began around <i>Kasparov</i>'s games against
			<a href="historical-milestones.html#DeepBlue" class="cescacs">Deep Blue</a>
			in 1996, and after long talks with Jaume Farràs in the 
			<a href="http://maps.google.es/maps?source=ig&hl=ca&q=moi%C3%A0,+barcelona&lr=&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Moi%C3%A0,+Barcelona,+Catalunya&z=12"
			class="cite" target="_blank">Barcelona town of Moià</a>,
			explaining to him the technique of computers to play chess, since I am a computer scientist.
			Debates began to turn to how to make chess more difficult for the machine.
		</p>
		<p>Well, nowadays they seem like naive origins in the face of new techniques like those of
			<a href="historical-milestones.html#Alphazero" class="cescacs">AlphaZero</a>, but at that time
			the machine had not yet definitively beaten <i>Kasparov</i>, and the discussion made more sense.
		</p>
		<p>As a computer scientist, discussions then focused on machine <q>power</q> were not enough, and using
			<q>heuristics</q> often requires transferring knowledge from experts to algorithms, a point that brings
			difficulties and shortcomings. Nowadays, the machine acquires this knowledge by learning, and games such
			as chess have been very suitable problems to consolidate advances in this field; we should be aware that
			human skills also have to be developed as machines incorporate advances, and games are a very suitable
			field to develop certain skills.
		</p>
		<p>The ideas for <i class="cescacs">C'escacs</i> began when a little research led me to the <q>discovery</q>
			of <i><cite>Gliński's hexagonal chess</cite></i>, and the first tries were made with a cardboard hexagonal
			board that I built. Thus began our first steps into the world of hexagonal chess. The hexagonal geometry
			increased the search space significantly, and could be further increased by making a larger board...
			and if some pieces incorporated more moves it would also help; We already knew <em><cite>Capablanca's
				chess</cite></em>, and the <a href="historical-milestones.html#Canceller" class="cite"><em>Chancellor</em></a>'s
			and <a href="historical-milestones.html#Arquebisbe" class="cite"><em>Archbishop</em></a>'s pieces.
		</p>
		<p>Finally, in 2007, the talks and ideas materialised on a cardboard board, and we started the first games with
			a primitive version of <i class="cescacs">C'escacs</i>, which initially used a piece called
			<a href="glossary.html#Princep" class="cescacs"><cite>Prince</cite></a>, with the same moves as the king,
			but without royalty. For this first version there was a program in a <cite>Java</cite> <cite>Applet</cite>
			to test the moves, save and visualise the games from a web page in <i>Geocities</i> (a service that
			<em>Yahoo!</em> closed down), where there were also published the rules.
		</p>
		<aside>
			<p>Although the name of the <a href="glossary.html#Pegas" target="_blank" class="cite">Pegasus</a> and
				the <a href="glossary.html#Drac" target="_blank" class="cite">Dragon</a> had been carefully chosen,
				we realised that the name <a href="glossary.html#Princep" class="cescacs"><cite>Prince</cite></a>
				was inadequate without the royalty... although in fact the problem
				was that the piece was not the right one.
			</p>
		</aside>
		<p>We already had the first version of the game and the website when we contacted
			<em><a href="historical-milestones.html#EscacsMccooey" target="_blank" class="cite"><b>Dave
				McCooey</b></a></em>, who very kindly listened to our ideas. His comments were of great
			help in finalising the initial design of <i class="cescacs">C'escacs</i>, particularly the pawn moves,
			which had not yet been defined.
			As a result of these email conversations the <i>pawn</i> was defined with the option to advance <i>double</i>
			and <i>triple</i> steps in the starting hexes; much later the <i>knight ride</i> was also incorporated,
			a difficult decision, but clearly necessary for similar reasons to those of the pawn movement.
		</p>
		<p><b>McCooey</b> also criticised us on two other points, which we did not change immediately, as we had
			to mature them:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The <a href="glossary.html#Princep" class="cescacs"><cite>Prince</cite></a>'s piece, which we used
				in the early versions, warned us that it was a very powerful piece. Moreover, on the 169 hexes board
				it was very slow. His diagnosis was absolutely right, and it was the weak point of the game. They
				still had no alternative, but the idea was to strengthen the power of the pawns, which could not
				build solid chains. Seeing that it was a piece of little use, we put aside the original idea of adding
				some kind of <a href="glossary.html#Regalia" class="cescacs">royalty</a>, as in
				<a href="historical-milestones.html#Xatranjalkabir" target="_blank" class="cite">Tamerlane's chess</a>,
				and began to think of alternatives. We also did some testing by adding the knight move and naming the
				new piece <i>Lion</i>, but the knight also suffered from a speed problem; adding more power to the
				piece was not the aim, and the <i>pawn</i> problem was not solved.
			</li>
			<li>He also criticised castling, saying that it contributed nothing. In fact this criticism later led
				to the incorporation of the <i>King's Leap</i>, the origin of castling, both in orthodox chess and
				in <i class="cescacs">C'escacs</i>, as the idea arose from the historical existence of this move.
				With the addition of the <i>King's Leap</i> we make a nod to the
				<em><a href="historical-milestones.html#Escacsvariantindia" class="cescacs">history of chess</a></em>,
				including the reference to the
				<a href="historical-milestones.html#LlibreDelsJocs" class="cescacs"><i>old King's Leap</i></a> of
				European chess, and the existence of both moves makes the mainly evasive function more evident.

				There was no point in forcing a castling, indeed, but the <i>Rook</i>'s move can, on occasion,
				represent an additional defence.

				Together with the <i>King's Leap</i> we incorporate the <em><i>double castling</i></em>, which allows
				a player to advance moves in a defensive position, but also allows a player with a tactical advantage
				to take an aggressive position, connecting with one move both <i>Rooks</i> on a column, although it
				is neither its function nor the objective of this move.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The <cite>Java</cite> <cite>Applet</cite> was successful and I was repeatedly asked to incorporate an
			engine that would allow games to be played against the machine; unfortunately the <i>Applet</i> was
			only intended to force valid moves and the programming had to be rewritten, and we had no time to
			devote to the project.
		</p>
		<p><em><b>Dave McCooey</b></em> carried out the <em><i>endgame analysis</i></em> on the 169-hexes board,
			confirming that <em>two knights</em> cannot mate a lone king, and also the <i>endgame analysis</i> of the
			<em><i>Prince</i></em>, a piece that has now been discarded in <i class="cescacs">C'escacs</i>.
		</p>
		<p><b>McCooey</b>'s other contribution was with regard to notation, drawing our attention to the naming
			of the columns, suggesting that we use for the central columns the same names as <cite>Gliński's columns</cite>,
			extending the columns left and right, but leaving the letter <em><i>F</i></em> for the central
			column. I found this point very interesting, but <cite>Gliński's notation</cite> is problematic, and I
			observed that by numbering the lines and advancing the numbering through the columns two by two the
			notation was much more coherent. This notation arose spontaneously, and on further research we found
			references in this coordinate system, obviously already invented, although it is rarely used, except in
			technological fields, given its suitability.
		</p>
		<p>In 2008 I acquired an <em><cite>Omega Chess</cite></em> (difficult to get in Spain). This chess variant is
			interesting, and incorporates a piece called <em><cite>Champion</cite></em>.
			We played a few games of <i class="cescacs">C'escacs</i> using a hexagonal adaptation of this piece,
			instead of the <cite>Prince</cite>, but it was cumbersome because of the diagonal jumps and, possibly
			because we were not well versed in <cite>Omega Chess</cite>, it was of little use to us.
			Making some adaptations to obtain simpler moves than the <cite>Champion</cite> is almost a requirement
			to use it in hexagonal chess games. We then called it <em><cite>Almogavar</cite></em>, but it was not the
			piece that <i class="cescacs">C'escacs</i> needed either.
		</p>
		<p>The ultimate alternative came with
			<em><a href="historical-milestones.html#Elefant" class="cescacs"><i>Elephants</i></a></em>, just the piece
			we wanted, which we adapted from
			Eastern (Burmese) chess by researching the history of chess, and finding that
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sittuyin" target="_blank" class="cite">Sittuyin</a> is still
			played today. The name <i>Elephant</i> has drawbacks in some languages, notably Arabic and Russian,
			as the <i>Bishop</i> is called <i>Elephant</i>, for historical reasons. In these languages the name
			<i>Halberdier</i> seems to us to be the most appropriate and consistent.
		</p>
		<p>The game was finally defined in 2018, although it was not published on the website until 2022, once all
			the changes had been thoroughly tested and confirmed; another change incorporated was the position of
			the <cite>Dragon</cite>, now definitely called <cite>Wyvern</cite>, although the name <i>Dragon</i>
			is still accepted. This change of position means that the piece has no weaknesses in the openings, delays
			its participation in the game in a positive way, and moves the Bishops forward, giving them more ease
			of movement at the start of the game.
		</p>
		<p>As for the <q>early aspirations</q> of making chess <q>difficult</q> for the machine, perhaps it does not
			make much sense today, but it could be a <q>new way</q> to play chess, if the machine <q>help</q> is a
			factor, and people direct the machine's strategy. This would already be a practically different game
			from chess, where the assisted players would have different skills than a chess player of today, and
			probably the game of <i class="cescacs">C'escacs</i> is not yet complex enough for such a challenge...
			But I have a new project of an extension of <i class="cescacs">C'escacs</i> to a virtual game, to be
			played only on computer. Hardly on real boards, as it would require twenty C'escacs boards (that's
			3_380 hexes). Lovers of strategy games would do well to remember that chess is king.
